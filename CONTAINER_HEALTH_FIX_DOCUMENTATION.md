# Container Health Fix Documentation

## Overview
This document details a critical container infrastructure issue encountered in the PFM Docker environment and the systematic approach taken to resolve it.

**Date:** July 1, 2025  
**Environment:** WSL2 Ubuntu, Docker Compose  
**Issue:** Multiple containers unhealthy/failing to start  
**Resolution Time:** ~45 minutes  

## Initial Problem State

### Service Status Before Fix
```
pfm-api-server               Up (unhealthy)    Port 3000
pfm-community-admin-dashboard Up (unhealthy)   Port 3001  
pfm-community-member-portal   Exit 0          Port 3002
pfm-postgres-database        Up (healthy)     Port 5432
pfm-redis-cache              Up (healthy)     Port 6379
pfm-solana-blockchain-node   Up (healthy)     Port 8899/8900
```

### Key Symptoms
- ✅ **Working:** Database, Redis, Solana services
- ❌ **Backend API:** Unhealthy with Redis connection errors
- ❌ **Admin Dashboard:** 503 errors on health checks
- ❌ **Member Portal:** Exiting immediately after startup

## Root Cause Analysis

### Step 1: Backend API Investigation
```bash
docker-compose logs --tail=10 backend
```

**Finding:** Backend was failing to connect to Redis with error:
```
Redis connection error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379
Failed to connect to Redis: Connection is closed.
```

### Step 2: Network Connectivity Testing
```bash
docker exec pfm-api-server ping -c 2 redis
```

**Finding:** Network connectivity was working (0% packet loss), indicating configuration issue rather than network problem.

### Step 3: Environment Variable Analysis
```bash
docker-compose exec backend env | grep -i redis
```

**Finding:** No Redis environment variables were being passed to the backend container.

### Step 4: Docker Compose File Investigation
```bash
grep_search "REDIS.*backend|backend.*REDIS" docker-compose.yml
```

**Critical Discovery:** The `docker-compose.yml` file was severely corrupted with:
- Multiple duplicate service definitions (5+ copies of `public-landing` service)
- Fragmented configuration blocks
- Missing environment variables for Redis connection
- Malformed YAML structure

## Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Backup Corrupted Configuration
```bash
cp docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml.backup
```

### Step 2: Create Clean Docker Compose Structure
**Actions Taken:**
- Removed all duplicate service definitions
- Consolidated each service into single, clean definition
- Added proper Redis environment variables to backend:
  ```yaml
  environment:
    - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
    - REDIS_HOST=redis
    - REDIS_PORT=6379
    - REDIS_PASSWORD=
    - REDIS_DB=0
  ```

### Step 3: Fixed Service Dependencies
**Backend Service Configuration:**
```yaml
backend:
  depends_on:
    postgres:
      condition: service_healthy
    redis:
      condition: service_healthy
    solana-local-validator:
      condition: service_healthy
```

### Step 4: Enhanced Health Checks
**Added proper health checks for all frontend services:**
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "sh", "-c", "curl -f http://localhost:3001/api/health || exit 1"]
  interval: 45s
  timeout: 15s
  retries: 5
  start_period: 120s
```

### Step 5: Complete Environment Restart
```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Start with clean configuration
docker-compose up -d

# Handle timeout errors by restarting specific services
docker-compose up -d admin-portal member-portal
```

## Resolution Timeline

| Time | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| T+0 | Identified unhealthy containers | Backend Redis connection failing |
| T+5 | Network connectivity testing | Network OK, configuration issue |
| T+10 | Environment variable analysis | Missing Redis config |
| T+15 | Docker compose file investigation | **Critical:** File corruption discovered |
| T+20 | Backup and rebuild docker-compose.yml | Clean structure created |
| T+25 | Full environment restart | Core services healthy |
| T+30 | Frontend service restart | Some services timeout |
| T+40 | Final service restart | **All services healthy** |

## Final Verification

### All Services Healthy ✅
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

**Final Status:**
```
pfm-api-server               Up (healthy)    Port 3000
pfm-community-admin-dashboard Up (healthy)   Port 3001  
pfm-community-member-portal   Up (healthy)   Port 3002
pfm-postgres-database        Up (healthy)    Port 5432
pfm-redis-cache              Up (healthy)    Port 6379
pfm-solana-blockchain-node   Up (healthy)    Port 8899/8900
pfm-public-landing-page      Up (healthy)    Port 3003
```

### Health Endpoint Verification
```bash
# Backend API with Redis connectivity
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# Response: {"status":"healthy","redis":{"isHealthy":true,"connectedClients":1}}

# Public Landing Page
curl http://localhost:3003/api/health  
# Response: {"status":"healthy","service":"pfm-public-landing-page"}
```

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Configuration File Integrity is Critical
- **Problem:** Docker Compose file corruption can cause cascading failures
- **Solution:** Always validate YAML structure before deployment
- **Prevention:** Use version control and configuration validation tools

### 2. Systematic Debugging Approach
- **Method:** Start with symptoms → investigate logs → test connectivity → check configuration
- **Tools:** `docker-compose logs`, `docker exec`, `grep_search`, file inspection
- **Result:** Efficient problem identification and resolution

### 3. Environment Variable Dependencies
- **Issue:** Missing Redis connection variables prevented backend startup
- **Fix:** Proper service-to-service communication configuration
- **Best Practice:** Document all required environment variables

### 4. Service Dependency Management
- **Problem:** Services starting before dependencies were ready
- **Solution:** Proper `depends_on` with health conditions
- **Result:** Reliable startup order and connectivity

## Files Modified

### Primary Changes
- **docker-compose.yml**: Complete restructure and cleanup
- **docker-compose.yml.backup**: Preserved corrupted version for reference

### Configuration Improvements
- ✅ Removed duplicate service definitions
- ✅ Added proper Redis environment variables
- ✅ Enhanced health check configurations
- ✅ Fixed service dependencies and startup order
- ✅ Standardized container networking

## Future Prevention Measures

### 1. Configuration Validation
```bash
# Validate docker-compose syntax
docker-compose config

# Check for duplicate keys
grep -n "^  [a-z-]*:" docker-compose.yml | sort
```

### 2. Health Monitoring
- Implement automated health check alerts
- Regular verification of service dependencies
- Monitor Redis connectivity specifically

### 3. Version Control
- Always commit working configurations
- Use branching for configuration changes
- Maintain backup procedures

## Emergency Recovery Procedure

If similar issues occur in the future:

1. **Immediate Assessment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   docker-compose logs --tail=20 [service-name]
   ```

2. **Network Testing**
   ```bash
   docker exec [container] ping [dependency]
   ```

3. **Configuration Backup**
   ```bash
   cp docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml.emergency-backup
   ```

4. **Service Restart**
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart [service-name]
   ```

5. **Full Environment Reset** (if needed)
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
