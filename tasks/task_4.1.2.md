## Containerization Integration

### Container Configuration
- **Port**: 3002 (member-portal service)
- **Dependencies**: backend:3000, redis:6379, solana:8899
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time service status tracking
- **API Communication**: Container-aware service discovery

### Key Features
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic detection of backend and blockchain services
- **Health Monitoring**: Live container status widgets in UI
- **Environment Flexibility**: Development container to production scaling
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time voting updates via container networking

### Performance Optimizations
- **Code Splitting**: Route and component-based optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis integration for session and real-time data
- **Bundle Analysis**: Container-specific bundle optimization
- **Resource Monitoring**: Container CPU/memory tracking

---

## Success Criteria
- [x] All member portal wireframes completed
- [x] Mobile-first responsive design included
- [x] Voting interface optimized for usability
- [x] Results visualization clear and engaging
- [x] Container integration fully documented
- [x] Real-time features designed for WebSocket integration
- [x] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
