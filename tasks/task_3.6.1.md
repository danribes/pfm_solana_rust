# Task 3.6.1: Solana Blockchain Integration

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of Solana blockchain integration for interacting with smart contracts, including transaction handling, event listening, and blockchain state management.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Solana Client Setup:**
   - Configure Solana connection (local validator, devnet, mainnet)
   - Set up wallet management and keypair handling
   - Implement connection pooling and retry logic
   - Add network switching capabilities

2. **Smart Contract Integration:**
   - Implement contract instruction calls
   - Set up transaction building and signing
   - Add transaction confirmation and error handling
   - Implement contract state queries

3. **Event Listening:**
   - Set up WebSocket connections for real-time events
   - Implement event filtering and processing
   - Add event persistence and caching
   - Handle event delivery failures and reconnection

4. **Transaction Management:**
   - Implement transaction queuing and retry logic
   - Add transaction status tracking
   - Set up transaction fee estimation
   - Implement transaction rollback and recovery

---

## Rationale
- **Blockchain Integration:** Enables direct interaction with smart contracts
- **Real-time Updates:** Provides live blockchain event processing
- **Reliability:** Handles network issues and transaction failures
- **Performance:** Optimizes blockchain interactions for better UX
