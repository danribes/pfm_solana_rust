# Task 3.4.2: Voting Operations API Endpoints

**Status:** Completed

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of RESTful API endpoints for voting operations, including vote casting, validation, and result aggregation.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Vote Service Implementation:**
   - Created `backend/services/votes.js` with comprehensive voting operations logic.
   - Implemented vote casting, validation, and results aggregation with business logic.
   - Added vote eligibility checking, integrity validation, and duplicate prevention.
   - Integrated real-time results calculation and analytics capabilities.

2. **Vote Controller Implementation:**
   - Created `backend/controllers/votes.js` with RESTful API endpoints.
   - Implemented proper HTTP status codes and comprehensive error handling.
   - Added input validation, authentication integration, and response formatting.
   - Ensured consistent JSON response structure across all endpoints.

3. **Vote Routes Implementation:**
   - Created `backend/routes/votes.js` with all required voting operation endpoints.
   - Implemented proper middleware chaining for authentication and validation.
   - Added route registration in `backend/app.js` under `/api/communities` prefix.
   - Ensured all endpoints follow established API patterns.

4. **Validation Middleware Extension:**
   - Extended `backend/middleware/validation.js` with comprehensive vote validation rules.
   - Added validation for vote casting, updates, validation endpoints, and results.
   - Implemented input sanitization and business rule enforcement.
   - Added proper error messages for validation failures.

5. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Created `backend/tests/api/votes.test.js` with endpoint structure validation.
   - Tested authentication requirements, input validation, and error handling.
   - Verified all endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes.
   - Ensured proper integration with existing application architecture.

---

## Rationale
- **Vote Integrity:** Ensures secure and valid voting process with comprehensive validation.
- **Real-time Results:** Provides live voting results and analytics for active questions.
- **User Experience:** Clear voting status, eligibility checking, and result access.
- **Security:** Prevents vote manipulation, ensures fairness, and supports blockchain integration.
- **Flexibility:** Supports multiple question types and anonymous voting options.

---

## Commands Used
- No additional dependencies required (used existing express-validator and sequelize).

---

## Errors & Edge Cases
- **Validation Errors:** All endpoints return detailed validation errors for invalid input.
- **Authentication Errors:** Proper 401/403 responses for authentication and authorization failures.
- **Not Found:** 404 returned for missing questions, votes, or invalid IDs.
- **Business Rules:** Vote deadline enforcement, duplicate prevention, member eligibility checks.
- **Vote Integrity:** Transaction signature validation and vote option verification.

## API Endpoints Implemented

### Vote Casting Endpoints:
- `POST /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/votes` - Cast a vote
- `GET /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/votes/my` - Get user's vote
- `PUT /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/votes` - Update user's vote
- `DELETE /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/votes` - Cancel user's vote

### Vote Validation Endpoints:
- `GET /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/votes/validate` - Validate vote eligibility
- `GET /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/votes/status` - Get voting status
- `POST /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/votes/check` - Check if user can vote

### Vote Results Endpoints:
- `GET /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/results` - Get voting results
- `GET /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/results/live` - Get live results
- `GET /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/results/export` - Export results
- `GET /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/results/analytics` - Get analytics
