# Task 2.4.4: Validation & Error Handling (Voting Question Creation)

---

## Overview
This document summarizes the validation logic and custom error codes used in the voting question creation handler of the Solana voting program.

---

## Validation Logic
- **Question Text Validation:**
    - Maximum length of 256 characters for question text.
    - Prevents excessively long questions that could impact UI and gas costs.
- **Options Validation:**
    - Minimum of 2 options required for meaningful voting.
    - Maximum of 4 options to balance flexibility with simplicity.
    - Individual option text length constraints.
- **Deadline Validation:**
    - Deadline must be in the future (greater than current timestamp).
    - Ensures questions have meaningful voting periods.
- **Access Control:**
    - Only approved members can create voting questions.
    - Prevents creation in dissolved communities.
    - Validates member status and community state.

---

## Error Codes
- `QuestionTooLong`: Question text exceeds 256 character limit.
- `TooManyOptions`: Number of options is less than 2 or greater than 4.
- `InvalidDeadline`: Deadline is not in the future.
- `NotApprovedMember`: Only approved members can create questions.
- `CommunityDissolved`: Cannot create questions in dissolved communities.

---

## Rationale
- **Explicit error codes** improve developer experience and make debugging easier.
- **Validation at the handler level** ensures on-chain state remains consistent and secure.
- **Access control** prevents unauthorized question creation and maintains community integrity.
