## ‚ùå Errors Encountered & Solutions

### Error 1: File Creation Method
**Problem:** Initial attempts to use edit_file tool failed for large component files
**Solution:** Switched to terminal `cat` commands with heredoc syntax for reliable file creation
**Command Used:** `cat > filename << 'EOF'`
**Rationale:** Provided better handling of large files with complex syntax

### Error 2: Directory Structure Issues
**Problem:** Missing parent directories when creating nested component structure
**Solution:** Used `mkdir -p` flag to create entire directory tree recursively
**Command Used:** `mkdir -p frontend/member/components/Registration`
**Rationale:** Ensures all parent directories are created automatically

### Error 3: Test Script Execution Permissions
**Problem:** Test validation script was not executable after creation
**Solution:** Added execute permissions before running the test suite
**Commands Used:** 
```bash
chmod +x test-task-4.4.5.js
node test-task-4.4.5.js
```
**Rationale:** Required for proper script execution in containerized environment
