# Task 2.6.4: Validation & Error Handling (Result Aggregation)

---

## Overview
This document summarizes the validation logic and error handling patterns relevant to result aggregation and access in the Solana voting program. It covers how the program ensures only valid votes are counted, how errors are surfaced during result queries, and best practices for off-chain consumers to handle edge cases and inconsistencies.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Reviewed on-chain validation logic:**
    - Ensured that only valid `Vote` accounts (created via the `cast_vote` instruction) are included in aggregation.
    - Confirmed that vote deduplication (one vote per member per question) is enforced at the account level (see Task 2.5.3).
    - Validated that only votes cast before the question deadline and for active questions are included.
2. **Documented error handling for result queries:**
    - Outlined how off-chain clients should handle missing, duplicate, or inconsistent vote data.
    - Provided guidance for handling account scan errors, event delivery failures, and data reconciliation.
3. **Enumerated relevant error codes:**
    - Listed custom error codes that may affect result aggregation (e.g., `DeadlinePassed`, `NotActive`, `NotApprovedMember`, `InvalidOption`).
    - Explained how these errors prevent invalid votes from being created in the first place.

---

## Rationale
- **On-chain validation** ensures only legitimate votes are counted, maintaining result integrity.
- **Explicit error codes** make it easier for clients to debug and handle edge cases.
- **Off-chain best practices** help maintain consistency and reliability in result aggregation, even in the face of network or event delivery issues.

## Commands Used
- No new on-chain code changes required for this subtask.
- Documentation only.

## Errors & Edge Cases
- **Vote account creation errors:**
    - `DeadlinePassed`: Attempt to vote after deadline.
    - `NotActive`: Attempt to vote on closed question.
    - `NotApprovedMember`: Voter is not an approved member.
    - `InvalidOption`: Selected option index is out of range.
    - Duplicate vote (PDA already exists): prevents double voting.
- **Result query errors:**
    - Account scan failures (network issues, RPC errors).
    - Event delivery failures (missed or delayed events).
    - Inconsistent state (e.g., event-driven state out of sync with on-chain reality).
- **Best practices:**
    - Periodic full account scans to reconcile state.
    - Defensive coding in clients to handle missing or unexpected data.
