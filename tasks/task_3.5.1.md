# Task 3.5.1: Wallet-Based Authentication System

**Status:** Completed

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of a comprehensive wallet-based authentication system using Solana wallet signatures for secure user authentication in the backend services.

> **Note:** Task 3.5.1 has been split into granular subtasks (3.5.1.1â€“3.5.1.5) for clarity and traceability. Each subtask is documented in its own markdown file in `/tasks`.

---

## Subtasks

- [x] 3.5.1.1 Nonce Management & Signature Verification ([task_3.5.1.1.md](task_3.5.1.1.md))
- [x] 3.5.1.2 Wallet Authentication Service ([task_3.5.1.2.md](task_3.5.1.2.md))
- [x] 3.5.1.3 Session Management Integration ([task_3.5.1.3.md](task_3.5.1.3.md))
- [x] 3.5.1.4 Authentication Middleware ([task_3.5.1.4.md](task_3.5.1.4.md))
- [x] 3.5.1.5 Authentication Tests ([task_3.5.1.5.md](task_3.5.1.5.md))

## Rationale
- **Security:** Wallet signatures provide cryptographic proof of ownership
- **User Experience:** Seamless wallet-based login without passwords
- **Blockchain Integration:** Native integration with Solana ecosystem
- **Trust:** Leverages existing wallet security and user trust
