# Task 5.4.2: Fallback Mechanisms & Offline Support

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of fallback mechanisms and offline support for the application, ensuring functionality even when network connectivity is limited.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Offline Mode Implementation:**
   - Offline state detection
   - Local data caching
   - Offline functionality preservation
   - Data synchronization on reconnection

2. **Fallback Strategies:**
   - Polling fallback for real-time updates
   - Local storage for critical data
   - Progressive enhancement
   - Graceful degradation

3. **Data Persistence:**
   - Local storage management
   - Cache invalidation strategies
   - Data versioning and conflicts
   - Storage quota management

4. **Reconnection Handling:**
   - Automatic reconnection
   - Data synchronization
   - Conflict resolution
   - User notification of status

---

## Rationale
- **Reliability:** Ensures application works in various network conditions
- **User Experience:** Seamless experience regardless of connectivity
- **Data Integrity:** Prevents data loss during connectivity issues
- **Accessibility:** Supports users with limited or intermittent connectivity

## Files to Create/Modify
- `frontend/shared/services/offline.ts` - Offline service
- `frontend/shared/hooks/useOffline.ts` - Offline hook
- `frontend/shared/contexts/OfflineContext.tsx` - Offline context
- `frontend/shared/utils/fallback.ts` - Fallback utilities
- `frontend/shared/types/offline.ts` - Offline types
- `frontend/shared/config/offline.ts` - Offline configuration
