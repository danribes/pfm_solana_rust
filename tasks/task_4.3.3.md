## Container Integration Notes

The member management system is fully integrated with the containerized environment:

1. **API Configuration**: Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable for backend communication
2. **Service Discovery**: Automatically connects to the `pfm-api-server` container
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when backend services are unavailable
4. **Development Mode**: Works with hot-reload in the admin portal container

---

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy and test the member management functionality:

1. **Ensure Containers Running:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   docker-compose ps  # Verify all containers healthy
   ```

2. **Access Member Management:**
   ```bash
   # Open browser to: http://localhost:3001
   # Navigate to Members section in sidebar
   ```

3. **Verify Functionality:**
   ```bash
   # Test API endpoints
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/communities
   ```

4. **Monitor Logs (if needed):**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs pfm-community-admin-dashboard
   docker-compose logs pfm-api-server
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

#### **Issue: Member Interface Shows Errors**
**Solution:**
1. Check container status: `docker-compose ps`
2. View container logs: `docker-compose logs pfm-community-admin-dashboard`
3. Restart if needed: `docker-compose restart pfm-community-admin-dashboard`

#### **Issue: API Calls Fail**
**Solution:**
1. Test backend: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
2. Check network connectivity between containers
3. Verify environment variables in admin container

#### **Issue: Empty Data Display**
**Expected:** This is normal for a fresh installation. Member data will populate as:
- Communities are created
- Members apply for membership
- Analytics data accumulates over time

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Real-time notifications for new applications
- Advanced member engagement scoring algorithms
- Integration with blockchain voting participation
- Member communication tools
- Advanced reporting and data visualization
- Mobile app support
