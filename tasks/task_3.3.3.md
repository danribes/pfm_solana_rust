# Task 3.3.3: User Profile & Authentication API Endpoints

**Status:** Completed

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of RESTful API endpoints for user profile management and wallet-based authentication in the backend services.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Wallet Authentication Service:**
   - Created `backend/services/wallet.js` with comprehensive wallet authentication logic.
   - Implemented nonce generation, signature verification, and wallet connection.
   - Added user creation/update on wallet connection with caching support.
   - Integrated with existing session management system.

2. **User Profile Service:**
   - Extended `backend/services/users.js` with complete user profile management.
   - Implemented profile CRUD operations, preferences, and notification settings.
   - Added avatar upload/removal functionality and user search capabilities.
   - Integrated caching for performance optimization.

3. **Authentication Controllers:**
   - Extended `backend/controllers/auth.js` with wallet-based authentication endpoints.
   - Implemented connect, verify, disconnect, status, and refresh operations.
   - Added legacy login/logout endpoints for backward compatibility.
   - Comprehensive error handling and validation.

4. **User Controllers:**
   - Extended `backend/controllers/users.js` with user profile management endpoints.
   - Implemented profile updates, preferences, notifications, and account management.
   - Added public profile access and user search functionality.
   - Proper validation and error handling.

5. **Validation Middleware:**
   - Extended `backend/middleware/validation.js` with user and wallet validation rules.
   - Added validation for profile updates, preferences, notifications, and wallet operations.
   - Implemented comprehensive input validation for all endpoints.

6. **API Routes:**
   - Created `backend/routes/users.js` with all user profile management endpoints.
   - Created `backend/routes/auth.js` with wallet authentication endpoints.
   - Registered routes in `backend/app.js` under `/api/users` and `/api/auth` prefixes.
   - Proper middleware chaining for authentication and validation.

7. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Extended `backend/tests/api/users.test.js` with complete user profile test coverage.
   - Created `backend/tests/api/auth.test.js` with wallet authentication test coverage.
   - Tested all endpoints with various scenarios including authentication, validation, and edge cases.

---

## Rationale
- **Complete User Experience:** Provides full user profile management and customization.
- **Secure Authentication:** Wallet-based authentication ensures secure, decentralized access.
- **Flexibility:** Supports user preferences and notification customization.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Maintains existing authentication endpoints while adding new wallet-based ones.
- **Performance:** Caching and optimization for better user experience.

---

## Commands Used
- No additional dependencies required (used existing express-validator and crypto).

---

## Errors & Edge Cases
- **Validation Errors:** All endpoints return detailed validation errors for bad input.
- **Authentication Errors:** Proper 401/403 responses for authentication failures.
- **Not Found:** 404 returned for missing users or invalid wallet addresses.
- **Business Rules:** Username uniqueness, email validation, and profile privacy controls.
- **Cache Management:** Proper cache invalidation on profile updates and wallet operations.

## API Endpoints Implemented

### User Profile Endpoints:
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update current user profile
- `GET /api/users/:id/profile` - Get public user profile
- `POST /api/users/profile/avatar` - Upload profile avatar
- `DELETE /api/users/profile/avatar` - Remove profile avatar

### User Preferences Endpoints:
- `GET /api/users/preferences` - Get user preferences
- `PUT /api/users/preferences` - Update user preferences
- `GET /api/users/notifications` - Get notification settings
- `PUT /api/users/notifications` - Update notification settings

### User Management Endpoints:
- `GET /api/users/search` - Search users
- `POST /api/users/deactivate` - Deactivate user account
- `POST /api/users/:id/reactivate` - Reactivate user account

### Wallet Authentication Endpoints:
- `POST /api/auth/wallet/connect` - Connect wallet and authenticate
- `POST /api/auth/wallet/nonce` - Generate nonce for authentication
- `POST /api/auth/wallet/verify` - Verify wallet signature
- `POST /api/auth/wallet/disconnect` - Disconnect wallet
- `GET /api/auth/wallet/:walletAddress/status` - Get wallet connection status
- `POST /api/auth/wallet/refresh` - Refresh authentication token

### Legacy Authentication Endpoints:
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with wallet address
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh session
