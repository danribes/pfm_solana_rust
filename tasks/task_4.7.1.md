## Steps to Take
1. **Component Testing:**
   - React component unit tests
   - Props and state testing
   - Event handling tests
   - Component rendering tests

2. **Hook Testing:**
   - Custom hook unit tests
   - State management testing
   - Side effect testing
   - Hook integration tests

3. **Utility Function Testing:**
   - Pure function testing
   - Data transformation tests
   - Validation function tests
   - Helper function tests

4. **Service Testing:**
   - API service tests
   - Mock service testing
   - Error handling tests
   - Service integration tests
