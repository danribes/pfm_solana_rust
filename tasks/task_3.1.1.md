# Task 3.1.1: Database Schema Design

---

## Overview
This document details the design and implementation of the PostgreSQL database schema for storing off-chain data related to the community management application. The schema will support user profiles, community metadata, voting analytics, and session management.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Design Core Tables:**
   - `users` - User profiles and wallet associations
   - `communities` - Community metadata and configuration
   - `members` - Community membership records
   - `voting_questions` - Question metadata and analytics
   - `votes` - Vote records for analytics and reporting
   - `sessions` - User session management
   - `analytics` - Usage and performance metrics

2. **Define Relationships:**
   - Foreign key constraints between tables
   - Indexes for performance optimization
   - Unique constraints for data integrity

3. **Create Migration Scripts:**
   - Initial schema creation
   - Version-controlled migrations
   - Rollback procedures

---

## Rationale
- **Off-chain Storage:** Reduces on-chain storage costs and improves query performance
- **Analytics Support:** Enables complex reporting and analytics queries
- **Session Management:** Provides secure user session handling
- **Scalability:** PostgreSQL handles high-volume data efficiently

---

## Files to Create/Modify
- `backend/database/schema.sql` - Main schema definition
- `backend/database/migrations/` - Migration scripts
- `backend/database/models/` - Database models (if using ORM)

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All core tables defined with proper relationships
- [ ] Indexes created for common query patterns
- [ ] Migration scripts tested and documented
- [ ] Schema supports all planned features (analytics, sessions, etc.)
