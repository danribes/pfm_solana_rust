# Task 5.3.1: End-to-End Wallet-Based Authentication Flow

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of end-to-end wallet-based authentication flow, ensuring secure authentication from frontend to backend to blockchain.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Authentication Flow Implementation:**
   - Wallet connection and signature verification
   - Backend authentication endpoint integration
   - Session token generation and validation
   - Authentication state management

2. **Security Measures:**
   - Nonce generation and verification
   - Replay attack prevention
   - Session hijacking protection
   - Authentication token security

3. **User Experience:**
   - Seamless authentication flow
   - Loading states and feedback
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Authentication persistence

4. **Cross-Portal Authentication:**
   - Shared authentication state
   - Portal switching with authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Authentication synchronization

---

## Rationale
- **Security:** Secure wallet-based authentication without passwords
- **User Experience:** Seamless authentication across portals
- **Reliability:** Robust authentication flow with proper error handling
- **Scalability:** Authentication system supports growth

## Files to Create/Modify
- `frontend/shared/services/auth.ts` - Authentication service
- `frontend/shared/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Authentication hook
- `frontend/shared/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication context
- `frontend/shared/components/AuthGuard.tsx` - Route protection
- `frontend/shared/utils/auth.ts` - Authentication utilities
- `frontend/shared/types/auth.ts` - Authentication types
