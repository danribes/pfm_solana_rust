# Task 6.3.1: Staging & Production Environment Setup (Cloud-Agnostic)

---

## Overview
This document details the setup of staging and production environments using cloud-agnostic tools and best practices.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Environment Provisioning:**
   - Use infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Ansible, etc.)
   - Define resources for backend, frontend, contracts
   - Set up databases, Redis, and storage
   - Configure networking and security groups

2. **Configuration Management:**
   - Use environment variables and secrets management
   - Separate configs for staging and production
   - Automate config injection in CI/CD
   - Document config requirements

3. **Deployment Targets:**
   - Support for AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.
   - Use Docker/Kubernetes for portability
   - Document provider-specific notes
   - Test deployments on multiple providers

4. **Environment Validation:**
   - Health checks and smoke tests
   - Automated environment validation scripts
   - Rollback and recovery plans
   - Access control and audit logging

---

## Rationale
- **Portability:** Deploy anywhere, avoid vendor lock-in
- **Reliability:** Consistent environments for all stages
- **Security:** Proper config and access management
- **Documentation:** Clear setup and maintenance instructions

## Files to Create/Modify
- `infra/` - Infrastructure-as-code scripts
- `config/` - Environment configs and secrets
- `README.md` - Environment setup documentation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Staging and production environments provisioned
- [ ] Cloud-agnostic deployment verified
