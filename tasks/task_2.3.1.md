# Task 2.3.1: Membership Approval Handler

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of the `approve_member` instruction in the Solana voting program. This handler is responsible for approving or rejecting pending membership requests, enforcing access control, and emitting the appropriate event.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Implemented `approve_member` handler:**
    - Accepts a boolean `approve` parameter (true = approve, false = reject).
    - Only the community admin can approve or reject members (access control).
    - Only members with `status = 0` (pending) can be approved or rejected.
    - If approved, sets `status = 1` and increments the community's `member_count`.
    - If rejected, sets `status = 2`.
    - Emits a `MemberApproved` event with relevant details (including status).

---

## Rationale
- **Access control** ensures only the admin can manage membership.
- **Explicit state transitions** (pending â†’ approved/rejected) prevent invalid or duplicate approvals.
- **Event emission** allows off-chain services to track membership changes in real time.
