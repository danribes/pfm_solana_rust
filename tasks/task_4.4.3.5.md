- ✅ Hot reload system functioning correctly
- ✅ TypeScript compilation issues identified and partially resolved

## 🚧 CURRENT CHALLENGES

### Compilation Blocking Issues
**Status: IDENTIFIED AND PARTIALLY RESOLVED**

While the voting pages are implemented correctly, there are TypeScript compilation errors in existing Community components that prevent the entire application from compiling. These errors include:

1. **Community Hook Mismatches**: `useMembership` hook interface doesn't match usage
2. **Interface Property Mismatches**: Several properties missing from `CommunityDetails` interface
3. **Import Path Issues**: Fixed `useWalletContext` import path error

### Voting-Specific Issues Resolved
- ✅ Fixed `UseVotingHistoryReturn` interface to include all required properties
- ✅ Removed problematic type exports from component index.ts
- ✅ Fixed voting hook integration errors

---

## 🧪 TESTING RESULTS

### Container Environment Testing
- **Container Status**: ✅ pfm-community-member-portal running healthy
- **File Creation**: ✅ All voting pages created successfully
- **Hot Reload**: ✅ Working correctly for development
- **Route Access**: ❌ 404 errors due to compilation blocking issues

### TypeScript Compilation
- **Voting Components**: ✅ No voting-related TypeScript errors
- **Overall Build**: ❌ Blocked by existing Community component errors
- **Interface Definitions**: ✅ All voting interfaces properly defined

---

## 📋 NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Fix Community Component Errors**: Address TypeScript errors in existing components
2. **Interface Alignment**: Update Community interfaces to match component usage
3. **Hook Standardization**: Align hook return types with component expectations

### Post-Resolution Testing
1. Verify voting routes work correctly (expect HTTP 200)
2. Test voting page functionality with mock data
3. Validate real-time updates integration
4. Confirm responsive design works across devices
