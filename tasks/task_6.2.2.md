# Task 6.2.2: CD Pipeline Structure & Deployment Automation

---

## Overview
This document details the design and implementation of the CD (Continuous Deployment) pipeline, automating deployment to staging and production environments.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Pipeline Stages:**
   - Build and package artifacts
   - Run smoke and sanity tests
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Deploy to production on approval

2. **Workflow Configuration:**
   - Use GitHub Actions (or chosen CD tool)
   - Define jobs for backend, frontend, contracts deployment
   - Set up environment variables and secrets
   - Configure manual approval gates for production

3. **Deployment Automation:**
   - Use Docker images for deployments
   - Push images to container registry
   - Use infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible)
   - Rollback on failure

4. **Notifications and Reporting:**
   - Notify team on deployment status
   - Publish deployment logs
   - Integrate with Slack/Discord/email if needed
   - Badge status for README

---

## Rationale
- **Speed:** Fast, automated deployments
- **Reliability:** Consistent, repeatable deployments
- **Visibility:** Clear reporting and notifications
- **Safety:** Manual approval for production

---

## Files to Create/Modify
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml` - Main CD workflow
- `infra/` - Infrastructure-as-code scripts
- `README.md` - Deployment documentation

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] CD pipeline automates deployments
- [ ] Manual approval for production
- [ ] Rollback on failure
- [ ] Deployment status and logs reported
