## Implementation Details

### Core Components Created:
- **Real-Time Demo Page**: `/real-time-demo` - Self-contained demonstration
- **useRealTimeData Hook**: Custom hook for polling and data management
- **RealTimeChartWrapper**: Enhanced chart component with live updates
- **Mock API Endpoints**: Demo data generators for realistic simulation

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Live Data Updates**: Automatic refresh every 3 seconds
- **Interactive Charts**: Bar charts, line charts with smooth animations
- **Visual Indicators**: Live status dots, timestamps, loading states
- **Real-Time Statistics**: Dynamic vote counts and participation metrics
- **Professional UI**: Modern design with responsive layout

### Technical Architecture:
- **Polling Strategy**: HTTP polling with 3-second intervals for demo
- **Chart Rendering**: SVG-based charts with smooth transitions
- **State Management**: React hooks for real-time data state
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and retry mechanisms
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering and memory management
