## Errors Encountered and Solutions

### Error 1: Beta Environment Isolation Issues
**Problem**: Beta users accessing production data and features
```bash
Error: Beta user accessing production community data
```

**Solution**: Strict environment separation with container namespacing
```yaml
# Beta environment configuration
beta-backend:
  environment:
    NODE_ENV: beta
    DATABASE_URL: postgresql://beta_user:beta_pass@beta-postgres:5432/pfm_beta
    REDIS_URL: redis://beta-redis:6379/1
  networks:
    - beta-network  # Isolated network for beta environment
```

### Error 2: Feedback Analytics Performance Issues
**Problem**: Large feedback datasets causing processing delays
```bash
Warning: Feedback analysis taking >10 minutes for daily reports
```

**Solution**: Implemented streaming analytics with Redis caching
```javascript
// Optimized feedback processing with streaming
const feedbackStream = redis.createReadStream('feedback:*');
feedbackStream.on('data', async (feedback) => {
  await processIncrementalAnalytics(feedback);
});

// Container-based analytics with dedicated resources
const analyticsContainer = {
  image: 'pfm-analytics:latest',
  resources: {
    limits: { memory: '2Gi', cpu: '1000m' }
  }
};
```

### Error 3: Community Platform Integration Conflicts
**Problem**: Discord/Telegram bot conflicts with existing services
```bash
Error: Multiple bot instances creating duplicate notifications
```

**Solution**: Centralized bot management with container orchestration
```yaml
# Dedicated community integration service
community-integrations:
  image: pfm-community-bots:latest
  environment:
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN: ${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
  deploy:
    replicas: 1  # Single instance to prevent conflicts
```

### Error 4: Launch Migration Data Consistency
**Problem**: Data synchronization issues during beta-to-production migration
```bash
Error: User data inconsistency during migration
```

**Solution**: Transactional migration with rollback capabilities
```bash
# Atomic migration script with verification
./scripts/launch/production-migration.sh \
  --atomic-transaction \
  --verify-data-consistency \
  --rollback-on-error \
  --backup-before-migration
```

### Error 5: Real-time Analytics Container Resource Limits
**Problem**: Analytics containers running out of memory during peak usage
```bash
Error: Analytics service OOMKilled during peak feedback processing
```

**Solution**: Auto-scaling analytics containers with horizontal pod autoscaling
```yaml
# Auto-scaling analytics service
analytics-service:
  image: pfm-analytics:latest
  deploy:
    resources:
      requests: { memory: '512Mi', cpu: '250m' }
      limits: { memory: '2Gi', cpu: '1000m' }
    autoscaling:
      min_replicas: 2
      max_replicas: 10
      target_cpu_utilization: 70
```
