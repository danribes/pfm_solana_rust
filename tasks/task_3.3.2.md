# Task 3.3.2: Membership Management API Endpoints

**Status:** Completed

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of RESTful API endpoints for membership management operations, including member applications, approvals, and role management.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Membership Service Layer:**
   - Created `backend/services/memberships.js` with comprehensive business logic for all membership operations.
   - Implemented membership application, approval, rejection, role management, and status updates.
   - Added pagination, filtering, and search functionality for member listings.
   - Integrated cache invalidation for membership changes.

2. **Membership Controllers:**
   - Implemented HTTP request/response logic in `backend/controllers/memberships.js` for all endpoints.
   - Added proper error handling with specific HTTP status codes.
   - Implemented comprehensive validation and business rule enforcement.

3. **Validation Middleware:**
   - Extended `backend/middleware/validation.js` with membership-specific validation rules.
   - Added validation for membership applications, role changes, status updates, and listing queries.
   - Implemented UUID validation for community and member IDs.

4. **Membership Routes:**
   - Created `backend/routes/memberships.js` with all RESTful endpoints for membership management.
   - Implemented proper middleware chaining for authentication, authorization, and validation.
   - Added role-based access control for admin/owner operations.

5. **App Integration:**
   - Registered membership routes in `backend/app.js` under `/api` prefix.
   - Ensured proper middleware order and session management.

6. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Created `backend/tests/api/memberships.test.js` with extensive test coverage.
   - Tested all endpoints with various scenarios including authentication, authorization, and edge cases.
   - Verified proper error handling and response formats.

---

## Rationale
- **Complete Workflow:** Supports full membership lifecycle from application to management.
- **Security:** Role-based access control ensures only authorized users can manage members.
- **Scalability:** Pagination and filtering support large communities with many members.
- **User Experience:** Clear status messages and proper error handling provide good UX.
- **Audit Trail:** Membership history tracking for accountability and transparency.

---

## Commands Used
- No additional dependencies required (used existing express-validator and express-rate-limit).

---

## Errors & Edge Cases
- **Validation Errors:** All endpoints return detailed validation errors for bad input.
- **Permission Errors:** Admin/owner checks return 401/403 as appropriate.
- **Not Found:** 404 returned for missing communities or memberships.
- **Conflict Errors:** 409 returned for duplicate applications or member limit exceeded.
- **Business Rules:** Prevents removing community owners and enforces member limits.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Ensured cache is invalidated on all membership changes.

- [`backend/routes/memberships.js`](../backend/routes/memberships.js): RESTful API endpoints for membership management with middleware integration.
- [`backend/middleware/validation.js`](../backend/middleware/validation.js): Extended with membership-specific validation rules for applications, role changes, and status updates.
- [`backend/app.js`](../backend/app.js): Registered membership routes under `/api` prefix.
- [`backend/tests/api/memberships.test.js`](../backend/tests/api/memberships.test.js): Comprehensive test suite covering all membership endpoints and scenarios.

## API Endpoints Implemented

### Membership Application Endpoints:
- `POST /api/communities/:id/members` - Apply to join community
- `GET /api/communities/:id/members` - List community members
- `GET /api/communities/:id/members/pending` - List pending applications
- `GET /api/memberships` - Get user's memberships across communities

### Membership Management Endpoints:
- `PUT /api/communities/:id/members/:memberId/approve` - Approve member
- `PUT /api/communities/:id/members/:memberId/reject` - Reject member
- `PUT /api/communities/:id/members/:memberId/remove` - Remove member
- `PUT /api/communities/:id/members/:memberId/role` - Change member role

### Membership Status Endpoints:
- `GET /api/communities/:id/members/:memberId/status` - Get member status
- `PUT /api/communities/:id/members/:memberId/status` - Update member status
- `GET /api/memberships/:id/history` - Get membership history

### Utility Endpoints:
- `GET /api/communities/:id/members/count` - Get community member count

## Success Criteria
- [x] All membership endpoints implemented
- [x] Role-based access control working
- [x] Membership state management working
- [x] Audit logging implemented (membership history)
- [x] API tests passing with good coverage

## Next Steps
- Implement User Profile & Authentication API Endpoints (Task 3.3.3)
- Expand API test coverage for edge cases and performance testing
