## Errors Encountered and Solutions

### Error 1: Container File Permissions Issues
**Problem**: File uploads failing due to container permission conflicts
```bash
Error: EACCES: permission denied, open '/app/uploads/file.jpg'
```

**Solution**: Configured proper container user permissions and volume mounting
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile permission configuration
RUN groupadd -r upload && useradd -r -g upload upload
RUN mkdir -p /app/uploads && chown -R upload:upload /app/uploads
USER upload

# docker-compose.yml volume configuration
services:
  backend:
    volumes:
      - file_storage:/app/uploads
      - ./backend:/app
    user: "1001:1001"  # Consistent user across containers
```

### Error 2: Image Processing Memory Exhaustion
**Problem**: Large image processing causing container memory issues
```bash
Error: JavaScript heap out of memory during image processing
```

**Solution**: Implemented streaming image processing with memory management
```javascript
// Memory-efficient image processing
const processImageStreaming = async (inputPath, outputPath, options) => {
  const transformer = sharp(inputPath)
    .resize(options.width, options.height, {
      fit: 'cover',
      withoutEnlargement: true
    })
    .jpeg({ 
      quality: options.quality || 80,
      progressive: true,
      mozjpeg: true
    });
  
  // Process in chunks to manage memory
  const chunks = [];
  const stream = transformer.stream();
  
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    stream.on('data', chunk => chunks.push(chunk));
    stream.on('end', () => {
      const buffer = Buffer.concat(chunks);
      fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, buffer);
      resolve(outputPath);
    });
    stream.on('error', reject);
  });
};
```

### Error 3: File Type Validation Bypass
**Problem**: Malicious files bypassing MIME type validation
```bash
Security Alert: Executable file uploaded with image MIME type
```

**Solution**: Implemented multi-layer file validation with content analysis
```javascript
// Comprehensive file validation
const validateFileUpload = async (file) => {
  // Layer 1: Extension validation
  const allowedExtensions = ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.pdf', '.doc', '.docx'];
  const fileExtension = path.extname(file.originalname).toLowerCase();
  if (!allowedExtensions.includes(fileExtension)) {
    throw new Error('File type not allowed');
  }
  
  // Layer 2: MIME type validation
  const allowedMimeTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'application/pdf'];
  if (!allowedMimeTypes.includes(file.mimetype)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid MIME type');
  }
  
  // Layer 3: File signature validation
  const fileType = await import('file-type');
  const detectedType = await fileType.fromBuffer(file.buffer);
  if (!detectedType || !allowedMimeTypes.includes(detectedType.mime)) {
    throw new Error('File signature validation failed');
  }
  
  // Layer 4: Content scanning
  const scanResult = await scanFileForMalware(file.buffer);
  if (scanResult.infected) {
    throw new Error('Malware detected in file');
  }
  
  return true;
};
```

### Error 4: Thumbnail Generation Container Timeout
**Problem**: Video thumbnail generation timing out in containers
```bash
Error: FFmpeg process timeout after 30 seconds
```

**Solution**: Optimized video processing with background job processing
```javascript
// Asynchronous video thumbnail generation
const generateVideoThumbnail = async (videoPath, thumbnailPath) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const ffmpeg = require('fluent-ffmpeg');
    
    ffmpeg(videoPath)
      .on('end', () => resolve(thumbnailPath))
      .on('error', (err) => reject(err))
      .screenshots({
        timestamps: ['50%'],
        filename: path.basename(thumbnailPath),
        folder: path.dirname(thumbnailPath),
        size: '320x240'
      });
  });
};

// Background job processing
const thumbnailQueue = Queue('thumbnail generation', {
  redis: { host: 'redis', port: 6379 }
});

thumbnailQueue.process('video-thumbnail', async (job) => {
  const { videoPath, thumbnailPath } = job.data;
  return await generateVideoThumbnail(videoPath, thumbnailPath);
});
```

### Error 5: File Storage Quota Enforcement
**Problem**: Users exceeding storage quotas without proper enforcement
```bash
Warning: User storage quota exceeded - upload continuing
```

**Solution**: Implemented real-time quota checking and enforcement
```javascript
// Real-time storage quota enforcement
const checkStorageQuota = async (userId, fileSize) => {
  const user = await User.findByPk(userId, {
    include: [{ model: StorageQuota }]
  });
  
  const currentUsage = await File.sum('size', {
    where: { userId, deleted: false }
  }) || 0;
  
  const quotaLimit = user.StorageQuota?.limit || DEFAULT_QUOTA_LIMIT;
  
  if (currentUsage + fileSize > quotaLimit) {
    throw new Error(`Storage quota exceeded. Used: ${formatBytes(currentUsage)}, Limit: ${formatBytes(quotaLimit)}`);
  }
  
  return {
    allowed: true,
    usage: currentUsage,
    limit: quotaLimit,
    remaining: quotaLimit - currentUsage
  };
};

// Pre-upload quota validation middleware
const validateQuota = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const fileSize = parseInt(req.headers['content-length']);
    const userId = req.user.id;
    
    const quotaCheck = await checkStorageQuota(userId, fileSize);
    req.quotaInfo = quotaCheck;
    
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(413).json({ error: error.message });
  }
};
```
