# Task 6.1.2: Automated Backend Tests in CI

---

## Overview
This document details the setup of automated testing for backend services, ensuring all backend logic is tested in the CI pipeline.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Test Suite Organization:**
   - Organize backend unit and integration tests
   - Ensure all API endpoints and business logic are covered
   - Add edge case and regression tests

2. **CI Integration:**
   - Add backend test job to CI pipeline
   - Use Docker Compose for backend dependencies (DB, Redis)
   - Configure test reporting (e.g., JUnit, code coverage)

3. **Test Data Management:**
   - Use fixtures and seed data for tests
   - Clean up test data after runs
   - Mock external services if needed

4. **Failure Handling:**
   - Fail CI on test failure
   - Output logs and diagnostics
   - Notify team on failures

---

## Rationale
- **Reliability:** Prevents regressions in backend logic
- **Automation:** Ensures tests run on every commit/PR
- **Visibility:** Test results visible in CI dashboard
- **Quality:** High confidence in backend services

---

## Files to Create/Modify
- `backend/api/__tests__/` - Backend test files
- `.github/workflows/ci-backend.yml` - CI workflow for backend
- `backend/api/README.md` - Testing instructions

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All backend tests automated in CI
- [ ] Test failures block merges
- [ ] Test results and coverage reported
- [ ] Team notified on failures
