# Task 3.4.1: Voting Question Management API Endpoints

**Status:** Completed

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of RESTful API endpoints for voting question management, including question creation, configuration, and lifecycle management.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Question Service Implementation:**
   - Created `backend/services/questions.js` with comprehensive voting question management logic.
   - Implemented CRUD operations, status management, and configuration handling.
   - Added authorization checks ensuring only community members can create questions.
   - Integrated business logic validation for question states and permissions.

2. **Question Controller Implementation:**
   - Created `backend/controllers/questions.js` with RESTful API endpoints.
   - Implemented proper HTTP status codes and comprehensive error handling.
   - Added input validation, authentication integration, and response formatting.
   - Ensured consistent JSON response structure across all endpoints.

3. **Question Routes Implementation:**
   - Created `backend/routes/questions.js` with all required question management endpoints.
   - Implemented proper middleware chaining for authentication and validation.
   - Added route registration in `backend/app.js` under `/api/communities` prefix.
   - Ensured all endpoints follow established API patterns.

4. **Validation Middleware Extension:**
   - Extended `backend/middleware/validation.js` with comprehensive question validation rules.
   - Added validation for question creation, updates, options, deadlines, and status.
   - Implemented input sanitization and business rule enforcement.
   - Added proper error messages for validation failures.

5. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Created `backend/tests/api/questions.test.js` with endpoint structure validation.
   - Tested authentication requirements, input validation, and error handling.
   - Verified all endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes.
   - Ensured proper integration with existing application architecture.

---

## Rationale
- **Question Lifecycle:** Supports complete question management workflow from creation to closure.
- **Validation:** Ensures data integrity and business rule compliance across all operations.
- **Access Control:** Restricts question management to authorized users with proper role-based permissions.
- **Status Management:** Provides clear question state tracking and filtering capabilities.
- **API Consistency:** Follows established patterns for maintainability and developer experience.

---

## Commands Used
- No additional dependencies required (used existing express-validator and sequelize).

---

## Errors & Edge Cases
- **Validation Errors:** All endpoints return detailed validation errors for invalid input.
- **Authentication Errors:** Proper 401/403 responses for authentication and authorization failures.
- **Not Found:** 404 returned for missing questions or invalid community/question IDs.
- **Business Rules:** Question state protection (cannot modify after voting starts), option count limits.
- **Authorization:** Creator-only updates with admin/moderator override capabilities.

---

## Files Created/Modified
- [`backend/services/questions.js`](../backend/services/questions.js): Comprehensive voting question service with CRUD operations, status management, and business logic.
- [`backend/controllers/questions.js`](../backend/controllers/questions.js): RESTful API controllers with proper error handling and response formatting.
- [`backend/routes/questions.js`](../backend/routes/questions.js): Question management API routes with authentication and validation middleware.
- [`backend/middleware/validation.js`](../backend/middleware/validation.js): Extended with question validation rules for creation, updates, options, deadlines, and status.
- [`backend/app.js`](../backend/app.js): Registered question routes under `/api/communities` prefix.
- [`backend/tests/api/questions.test.js`](../backend/tests/api/questions.test.js): Comprehensive endpoint structure validation and testing.

## API Endpoints Implemented

### Question CRUD Endpoints:
- `POST /api/communities/:id/questions` - Create voting question
- `GET /api/communities/:id/questions` - List community questions
- `GET /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId` - Get question details
- `PUT /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId` - Update question
- `DELETE /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId` - Delete question

### Question Configuration Endpoints:
- `PUT /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/options` - Update question options
- `PUT /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/deadline` - Update deadline
- `POST /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/activate` - Activate question
- `POST /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/close` - Close question

### Question Status Endpoints:
- `GET /api/communities/:id/questions/:questionId/status` - Get question status
- `GET /api/communities/:id/questions/active` - List active questions
- `GET /api/communities/:id/questions/closed` - List closed questions
- `GET /api/communities/:id/questions/pending` - List pending questions
- `GET /api/communities/:id/questions/inactive` - List inactive questions

## Key Features Implemented

### Question Management:
- ✅ **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete functionality
- ✅ **Question Types**: Support for single_choice, multiple_choice, ranked_choice
- ✅ **Options Management**: 2-10 options per question with validation
- ✅ **Deadline Management**: Start/end date configuration with timezone handling
- ✅ **Status Tracking**: Active, pending, closed, inactive states

### Authorization & Security:
- ✅ **Member-only Creation**: Only active community members can create questions
- ✅ **Creator/Admin Updates**: Question creators and community admins/moderators can update
- ✅ **Voting State Protection**: Cannot modify questions after voting starts
- ✅ **Session-based Authentication**: Secure session management

### Configuration & Validation:
- ✅ **Question Settings**: Anonymous voting, member approval, vote thresholds
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all fields
- ✅ **Business Rules**: Enforce question lifecycle constraints
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Meaningful error messages and proper HTTP status codes

### API Features:
- ✅ **Pagination**: Support for page/limit parameters
- ✅ **Sorting**: Multiple sort options (created_at, title, etc.)
- ✅ **Filtering**: Status-based filtering (active, closed, pending, inactive)
- ✅ **Response Formatting**: Consistent JSON response structure
