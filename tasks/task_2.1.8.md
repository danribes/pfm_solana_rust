# Task 2.1.8: Test Stubbing

---

## Overview
To ensure the correctness and reliability of the on-chain program, a comprehensive test suite was stubbed out in TypeScript using the Anchor testing framework. This provides a clear roadmap for test-driven development.

---

## Steps Taken
1.  **Created Test File:** A new test file was created at `contracts/voting/tests/voting.ts`.
2.  **Outlined `describe` Blocks:** The test suite is organized into logical blocks using `describe`, with a top-level block for the "voting" program and nested blocks for each major feature (Community, Membership, Voting).
3.  **Wrote `it` Stubs:** For each scenario, an `it` block was created with a descriptive name for the test case. The test function is currently empty, pending implementation.

## Test Coverage (Stubbed)

### Community Management
-   `it("Is initialized!", ...)`: Basic test to ensure the program deploys correctly.
-   `it("Creates a new community", ...)`: Tests successful community creation with valid inputs.
-   `it("Fails to create community with empty name", ...)`: Tests input validation for the community name.
-   `it("Updates community config", ...)`: Tests the `update_community_config` instruction.
-   `it("Dissolves a community", ...)`: Tests the `dissolve_community` instruction.
-   `it("Fails to join a dissolved community", ...)`: Tests the edge case of interacting with a dissolved community.

### Member Management
-   `it("Lets a user join a community", ...)`: Tests successful member application (status becomes `Pending`).
-   `it("Admin approves a member", ...)`: Tests the happy path for member approval.
-   `it("Admin rejects a member", ...)`: Tests the rejection path for a member.
-   `it("Fails to approve member if not admin", ...)`: Tests access control.
-   `it("Admin removes a member", ...)`: Tests the `remove_member` instruction.
-   `it("Allows a removed member to re-apply", ...)`: Tests the re-application logic.

### Voting
-   `it("Creates a voting question", ...)`: Tests successful question creation by an approved member.
-   `it("Fails to create question if not an approved member", ...)`: Tests access control.
-   `it("Lets an approved member cast a vote", ...)`: Tests the happy path for voting.
-   `it("Fails to vote if not an approved member", ...)`: Tests access control for voting.
-   `it("Fails to vote twice on the same question", ...)`: Tests the one-vote-per-person constraint.
-   `it("Fails to vote after the deadline", ...)`: Tests the deadline validation.
-   `it("Closes a voting question after deadline", ...)`: Tests the `close_voting_question` instruction.

---

## Rationale
-   **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Foundation:** Stubbing out tests first clarifies the expected behavior and requirements for each function before or during implementation.
-   **Comprehensive Coverage:** The stubs cover happy paths, failure cases (validation, access control), and edge cases, ensuring all aspects of the program's logic will be tested.
-   **Developer Guidance:** The test file serves as living documentation and a clear guide for developers on how the program is intended to be used and what needs to be completed.

---

## Next Steps
-   Implement the logic within each `it` block using `@coral-xyz/anchor` to interact with the on-chain program.
-   Add assertions (`assert`) to verify that the program state changes as expected after each instruction.
-   Run the full test suite using the `anchor test` command.
