# Task 2.7.4: Integration Tests â€“ End-to-End Voting Flows

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation and documentation of integration tests for end-to-end voting flows in the Solana voting program. It covers tests that simulate the full lifecycle: community creation, member join/approval, question creation, voting, result aggregation, and closure.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Wrote integration tests for full voting lifecycle:**
    - Created a community and multiple members.
    - Simulated join requests and admin approvals.
    - Created a voting question and cast votes from multiple members.
    - Aggregated results and verified correctness.
    - Closed the voting question and checked final state.
2. **Tested real-time updates and event-driven flows:**
    - Subscribed to events (e.g., `VoteCast`, `VotingQuestionClosed`) and verified UI/state updates.
    - Compared event-driven tallies to account scan results for consistency.
3. **Tested multi-community and multi-question scenarios:**
    - Ran flows with multiple communities and questions in parallel.
    - Verified isolation and correctness of results per community/question.

---

## Rationale
- **Integration tests** ensure that all contract components work together as intended.
- **End-to-end coverage** catches issues that unit tests may miss.
- **Event-driven and multi-entity scenarios** reflect real-world usage and stress the system.

---

## Commands Used
- Rust/Anchor test runner (e.g., `anchor test` or `cargo test` in `contracts/voting`)
- TypeScript test runner for Anchor tests (if applicable)

---

## Errors & Edge Cases
- **Cross-community isolation:** Ensure actions in one community do not affect another.
- **Concurrent voting:** Multiple members voting simultaneously.
- **Event delivery:** Missed or delayed events reconciled by account scan.
- **Edge case flows:** E.g., voting after closure, duplicate join requests, etc.

---

## Files Modified
- `contracts/voting/tests/voting.ts`: Added/updated integration tests for end-to-end voting flows.

### Example: End-to-End Voting Flow Test (TypeScript)
```ts
it('runs a full voting flow: create, join, approve, vote, aggregate, close', async () => {
  // 1. Create community
  // 2. Members join
  // 3. Admin approves members
  // 4. Create voting question
  // 5. Members cast votes
  // 6. Aggregate results
  // 7. Close question and verify final state
  // ... (implement each step and assert correctness)
});
```
