# Task 6.2.1: CI Pipeline Structure & Workflow Design

---

## Overview
This document details the design and implementation of the CI pipeline structure, ensuring all services are built, tested, and validated on every commit/PR.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Pipeline Stages:**
   - Linting and static analysis
   - Build and dependency installation
   - Unit, integration, and e2e tests
   - Code coverage reporting
   - Artifact creation (if needed)

2. **Workflow Configuration:**
   - Use GitHub Actions (or chosen CI tool)
   - Define jobs for contracts, backend, frontend
   - Set up job dependencies and triggers
   - Configure environment variables and secrets

3. **Parallelization and Optimization:**
   - Run independent jobs in parallel
   - Cache dependencies for faster builds
   - Use matrix builds for multiple environments
   - Fail fast on critical errors

4. **Notifications and Reporting:**
   - Notify team on failures and recoveries
   - Publish test and coverage reports
   - Integrate with Slack/Discord/email if needed
   - Badge status for README

---

## Rationale
- **Speed:** Fast feedback on code changes
- **Reliability:** Consistent, repeatable builds and tests
- **Visibility:** Clear reporting and notifications
- **Scalability:** Supports growing codebase and team

---

## Files to Create/Modify
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI workflow
- `.github/workflows/ci-contracts.yml` - Contracts CI job
- `.github/workflows/ci-backend.yml` - Backend CI job
- `.github/workflows/ci-frontend.yml` - Frontend CI job
- `README.md` - CI badge and documentation

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] CI pipeline runs on every commit/PR
- [ ] All jobs run in correct order
- [ ] Reports and notifications working
- [ ] Pipeline optimized for speed and reliability
