# Task 6.6.4: CDN Integration & Performance Optimization

---

## Overview
Implement Content Delivery Network (CDN) integration and comprehensive performance optimization for the PFM Community Management Application. This ensures fast global content delivery, reduced server load, and optimal user experience across geographic locations.

---

## Steps to Take

### 1. **CDN Provider Selection & Setup**
   - CDN provider evaluation (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, Google Cloud CDN)
   - Global edge location coverage assessment
   - Cost analysis and bandwidth optimization
   - CDN configuration and origin server setup
   - DNS configuration for CDN routing

### 2. **Static Asset Optimization**
   - Asset bundling and minification
   - Image optimization and modern format support (WebP, AVIF)
   - Font optimization and subsetting
   - CSS and JavaScript optimization
   - Asset versioning and cache busting

### 3. **Caching Strategy Implementation**
   - Cache-Control header optimization
   - Static vs dynamic content caching rules
   - Edge caching configuration
   - Browser caching policies
   - Cache invalidation and purging mechanisms

### 4. **Performance Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Core Web Vitals monitoring
   - Page load time tracking
   - CDN performance metrics
   - User experience monitoring
   - Geographic performance analysis

### 5. **Advanced Performance Features**
   - HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 optimization
   - Preloading and prefetching strategies
   - Service worker implementation
   - Progressive web app (PWA) features
   - Critical resource prioritization

---

## Rationale
- **User Experience:** Provides fast loading times globally
- **Scalability:** Reduces origin server load and handles traffic spikes
- **Cost Efficiency:** Optimizes bandwidth usage and server resources
- **SEO Benefits:** Improves search engine rankings through performance
