# Task 6.4.2: Logging Best Practices & Log Management

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of logging best practices and log management for all services.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Logging Standards:**
   - Define log formats and levels (info, warn, error, debug)
   - Include request IDs and trace context
   - Mask sensitive data in logs
   - Use structured logging (JSON, etc.)

2. **Log Collection:**
   - Centralize logs from all services
   - Use log shippers (Filebeat, Fluentd, etc.)
   - Integrate with log aggregation tools (ELK, Loki, etc.)
   - Configure log rotation and retention

3. **Log Analysis:**
   - Set up dashboards for log analysis
   - Implement log-based alerting
   - Enable full-text search and filtering
   - Document log query patterns

4. **Compliance and Security:**
   - Ensure logs meet compliance requirements
   - Control access to logs
   - Audit log access and changes
   - Document log retention policies

## Rationale
- **Debugging:** Easier troubleshooting and root cause analysis
- **Security:** Protect sensitive data and control access
- **Compliance:** Meet regulatory requirements
- **Visibility:** Centralized, searchable logs
