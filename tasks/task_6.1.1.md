# Task 6.1.1: Automated Contract Tests in CI

---

## Overview
This document details the setup of automated testing for Solana smart contracts, ensuring all contract logic is tested in the CI pipeline.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Test Suite Organization:**
   - Organize Anchor/TypeScript contract tests
   - Ensure all contract logic is covered
   - Add edge case and regression tests

2. **CI Integration:**
   - Add contract test job to CI pipeline
   - Use Anchor CLI and Solana test validator in CI
   - Configure test reporting (e.g., JUnit, code coverage)

3. **Test Data Management:**
   - Use fixtures for deterministic tests
   - Clean up test accounts after runs
   - Mock external dependencies if needed

4. **Failure Handling:**
   - Fail CI on test failure
   - Output logs and diagnostics
   - Notify team on failures

---

## Rationale
- **Reliability:** Prevents regressions in contract logic
- **Automation:** Ensures tests run on every commit/PR
- **Visibility:** Test results visible in CI dashboard
- **Quality:** High confidence in on-chain logic

---

## Files to Create/Modify
- `contracts/tests/` - Contract test files
- `.github/workflows/ci-contracts.yml` - CI workflow for contracts
- `contracts/README.md` - Testing instructions

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All contract tests automated in CI
- [ ] Test failures block merges
- [ ] Test results and coverage reported
- [ ] Team notified on failures
