# Task 7.4.1: Live Website Testing & User Acceptance

---

## Overview
Conduct comprehensive live website testing and user acceptance testing for the PFM Community Management Application before public launch. This ensures platform stability, usability, and readiness for public users.

---

## Steps to Take

### 1. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
   - Real user testing with diverse user groups
   - Task-based usability testing scenarios
   - Accessibility testing with assistive technologies
   - Cross-browser and cross-device testing
   - Performance testing under realistic conditions

### 2. **Beta User Program**
   - Beta user recruitment and onboarding
   - Structured feedback collection system
   - Beta user community management
   - Iterative improvement based on feedback
   - Beta to production migration planning

### 3. **Load & Performance Testing**
   - Production environment load testing
   - Stress testing with peak traffic simulation
   - Database performance under load
   - CDN and caching effectiveness testing
   - Blockchain integration performance testing

### 4. **Security & Compliance Testing**
   - Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment
   - Data privacy and GDPR compliance verification
   - Wallet security and blockchain integration testing
   - SSL/TLS configuration verification
   - API security and rate limiting testing

### 5. **Bug Tracking & Resolution**
   - Comprehensive bug reporting system
   - Priority-based bug triage and resolution
   - Regression testing after fixes
   - Performance optimization based on findings
   - Final pre-launch quality assurance

---

## Rationale
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensures platform meets quality standards before public launch
- **User Experience:** Validates platform usability with real users
- **Risk Mitigation:** Identifies and resolves issues before they affect public users
- **Performance Validation:** Confirms platform can handle expected user loads
