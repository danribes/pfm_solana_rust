# Task 2.6.5: Tests for Result Aggregation

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation and documentation of tests for result aggregation in the Solana voting program. It covers how to verify that vote results are correctly aggregated, accessible, and updated in real time, using both account scans and event-driven updates.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Added integration tests for result aggregation:**
    - Wrote TypeScript tests to cast multiple votes for a question and verify correct tallying of results via account scan.
    - Tested aggregation logic for multiple options and edge cases (e.g., no votes, all votes for one option, split votes).
2. **Added event-driven result update tests:**
    - Subscribed to `VoteCast` and `VotingQuestionClosed` events in tests to verify real-time updates.
    - Checked that event-driven tallies match account scan results after each vote and after question closure.
3. **Tested error and edge cases:**
    - Attempted to aggregate results for questions with no votes.
    - Verified that duplicate votes are not counted (enforced by PDA logic).
    - Tested aggregation after question deadline and closure.

---

## Rationale
- **Comprehensive testing** ensures that result aggregation logic is robust and reliable for both on-chain and off-chain consumers.
- **Event-driven tests** verify that real-time updates are accurate and consistent with on-chain state.
- **Edge case coverage** prevents regressions and ensures correct behavior in all scenarios.

---

## Commands Used
- TypeScript test runner (e.g., `yarn test` or `npm test` in `contracts/voting`)
- Anchor test framework for Solana programs

---

## Errors & Edge Cases
- **No votes:** Aggregation should return zero for all options.
- **Duplicate votes:** Only one vote per member per question is counted.
- **Late votes:** Votes after deadline or closure are not included.
- **Event delivery:** Missed events are reconciled by account scan.

---

## Files Modified
- `contracts/voting/tests/voting.ts`: Added/updated tests for result aggregation, event-driven updates, and edge cases.

### Example: Result Aggregation Test (TypeScript)
```ts
it('aggregates results correctly for a voting question', async () => {
  // Cast votes for different options
  await castVote(question, member1, 0);
  await castVote(question, member2, 1);
  await castVote(question, member3, 0);

  // Fetch all votes for the question
  const votes = await program.account.vote.all([
    { memcmp: { offset: 8, bytes: question.publicKey.toBase58() } },
  ]);

  // Aggregate results
  const tally = {};
  votes.forEach(({ account }) => {
    const option = account.selectedOption;
    tally[option] = (tally[option] || 0) + 1;
  });

  expect(tally[0]).to.equal(2);
  expect(tally[1]).to.equal(1);
});
```

### Example: Event-Driven Result Update Test
```ts
it('updates results in real time via VoteCast events', async () => {
  let lastTally = {};
  program.addEventListener('VoteCast', (event) => {
    lastTally[event.selectedOption] = (lastTally[event.selectedOption] || 0) + 1;
  });

  await castVote(question, member1, 0);
  await castVote(question, member2, 1);

  // Wait for events to be processed...
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));

  expect(lastTally[0]).to.equal(1);
  expect(lastTally[1]).to.equal(1);
});
```
