# Task 6.1.3: Automated Frontend Tests in CI

---

## Overview
This document details the setup of automated testing for frontend applications, ensuring all UI and logic is tested in the CI pipeline.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Test Suite Organization:**
   - Organize frontend unit, integration, and e2e tests
   - Ensure all components, hooks, and workflows are covered
   - Add edge case and regression tests

2. **CI Integration:**
   - Add frontend test job to CI pipeline
   - Use headless browser for e2e tests (e.g., Playwright, Cypress)
   - Configure test reporting (e.g., JUnit, code coverage)

3. **Test Data Management:**
   - Use fixtures and mocks for tests
   - Clean up test data after runs
   - Mock backend APIs if needed

4. **Failure Handling:**
   - Fail CI on test failure
   - Output logs and diagnostics
   - Notify team on failures

---

## Rationale
- **Reliability:** Prevents regressions in frontend logic
- **Automation:** Ensures tests run on every commit/PR
- **Visibility:** Test results visible in CI dashboard
- **Quality:** High confidence in frontend applications

## Files to Create/Modify
- `frontend/shared/__tests__/` - Frontend test files
- `.github/workflows/ci-frontend.yml` - CI workflow for frontend
- `frontend/README.md` - Testing instructions

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All frontend tests automated in CI
- [ ] Test failures block merges
- [ ] Test results and coverage reported
- [ ] Team notified on failures
