## Errors Encountered and Solutions

### Error 1: File Upload Container Permissions
**Problem**: File upload failing due to container permission issues
```bash
Error: EACCES: permission denied, open '/app/uploads/document.pdf'
```

**Solution**: Updated container configuration with proper file permissions
```dockerfile
# Updated Dockerfile
RUN mkdir -p /app/uploads && chown -R node:node /app/uploads
USER node
```

### Error 2: Multi-Step Form State Management
**Problem**: Form state loss during multi-step navigation
```bash
Error: Form data not persisting between steps
```

**Solution**: Implemented centralized form state management
```javascript
// State management with React Context
const JoinRequestContext = createContext();
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  step1: {},
  step2: {},
  step3: {},
  step4: {}
});
```

### Error 3: Dynamic Form Field Validation
**Problem**: Validation rules not applying to dynamically generated fields
```bash
Error: Dynamic field validation not working
```

**Solution**: Created flexible validation system for dynamic fields
```javascript
// Dynamic validation schema
const createValidationSchema = (fields) => {
  return fields.reduce((schema, field) => {
    schema[field.name] = field.validation || [];
    return schema;
  }, {});
};
```

### Error 4: Container Volume File Persistence
**Problem**: Uploaded files not persisting across container restarts
```bash
Warning: Uploaded files lost after container restart
```

**Solution**: Configured persistent volume mounting
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
backend:
  volumes:
    - upload_data:/app/uploads
    - ./backend:/app
    - /app/node_modules

volumes:
  upload_data:
    driver: local
```

### Error 5: Large File Upload Timeout
**Problem**: Large file uploads timing out in containerized environment
```bash
Error: Request timeout during file upload
```

**Solution**: Optimized file upload with chunking and progress tracking
```javascript
// Chunked file upload implementation
const uploadFileInChunks = async (file, chunkSize = 1024 * 1024) => {
  const chunks = Math.ceil(file.size / chunkSize);
  for (let i = 0; i < chunks; i++) {
    const chunk = file.slice(i * chunkSize, (i + 1) * chunkSize);
    await uploadChunk(chunk, i, chunks);
  }
};
```

### Error 6: Database Connection Pooling Issues
**Problem**: Database connection limits exceeded during high application volume
```bash
Error: Connection pool exhausted
```

**Solution**: Optimized database connection pooling
```javascript
// Database connection pool configuration
const pool = new Pool({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  port: process.env.DB_PORT,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME,
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  max: 20,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
});
```
