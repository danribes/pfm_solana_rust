# Task 3.6.2: Backend-Smart Contract Synchronization

**Status:** Completed

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of comprehensive synchronization between backend services and smart contracts, ensuring data consistency and real-time updates across the system.

---

## Steps Taken

### 1. Event Processing System Implementation
- **Created `backend/sync/events.js`**: Comprehensive event processing system with queue management and retry logic
- **Event Handlers**: Implemented handlers for all blockchain events (CommunityCreated, MemberJoined, VoteCast, etc.)
- **Queue Management**: Built-in processing queue with batching and error handling
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed events
- **Event Validation**: Comprehensive validation and error handling for all event types

### 2. State Synchronization Implementation
- **Created `backend/sync/state.js`**: Periodic state verification and data consistency checks
- **Synchronization Handlers**: Implemented sync handlers for communities, memberships, questions, votes, and users
- **Periodic Sync**: Automatic periodic synchronization with configurable intervals
- **Data Comparison**: Smart data comparison logic to detect inconsistencies
- **Consistency Reports**: Comprehensive reporting on data consistency across all entities

### 3. State Reconciliation Implementation
- **Created `backend/sync/reconciliation.js`**: Conflict resolution and data repair mechanisms
- **Conflict Detection**: Automated detection of data conflicts between blockchain and backend
- **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent conflict resolution with transaction safety
- **Data Repair**: Automatic repair of inconsistent data
- **Conflict Summary**: Detailed conflict reporting and statistics

### 4. Background Worker Implementation
- **Created `backend/workers/sync-worker.js`**: Background worker for handling synchronization tasks
- **Task Queue**: Robust task queue with priority handling and retry logic
- **Health Checks**: Regular health checks for all synchronization components
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive worker statistics and monitoring
- **Periodic Tasks**: Automated scheduling of synchronization tasks

### 5. Synchronization Service Implementation
- **Created `backend/services/sync.js`**: Unified interface for all synchronization operations
- **Service Management**: Complete service lifecycle management (initialize, shutdown)
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time status monitoring and health checks
- **Force Operations**: Manual force synchronization capabilities
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive synchronization statistics and reporting

### 6. Comprehensive Testing
- **Created `backend/tests/sync/events.test.js`**: Complete test suite for event processing
- **Created `backend/tests/sync/state.test.js`**: Complete test suite for state synchronization
- **Created `backend/tests/sync/reconciliation.test.js`**: Complete test suite for conflict resolution
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage for all synchronization components

---

## Rationale
- **Data Consistency:** Ensures backend and blockchain data stay synchronized at all times
- **Real-time Updates:** Provides immediate updates from blockchain events to backend
- **Reliability:** Handles network issues, processing failures, and data conflicts gracefully
- **Performance:** Optimizes synchronization for production load with batching and queuing
- **Monitoring:** Comprehensive monitoring and alerting for synchronization health
