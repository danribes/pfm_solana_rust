# Task 3.5.1.1: Nonce Management & Signature Verification

**Status:** Completed

---

## Overview
This subtask implements the foundational components for wallet-based authentication: nonce management and signature verification for Solana wallets.

---

## Steps Taken

### 1. Initial Analysis
- Checked backend structure for existing authentication and session management logic
- Found relevant files: `backend/services/wallet.js`, `backend/middleware/auth.js`, `backend/session/auth.js`, and `backend/session/store.js`
- No `backend/auth/` directory exists yet; created it for new wallet authentication logic
- No `backend/tests/auth/` directory exists yet; will create it for authentication tests

### 2. Nonce Management Implementation
- Created `backend/services/nonce.js` for nonce management
- Implemented functions to generate, store, retrieve, and invalidate nonces
- Used a simple in-memory Map for nonce storage (suitable for development/testing; will need Redis for production)
- **Problem:** No persistent store for nonces in current implementation
- **Solution:** Designed the service to be easily upgradable to Redis

### 3. Signature Verification Implementation
- Created `backend/auth/signature.js` for Solana wallet signature verification
- Used `@solana/web3.js` for public key and signature verification, and `bs58` for decoding
- Handles errors gracefully and returns a boolean for verification status
- **Problem:** None encountered; standard libraries used

---

## Rationale
- **Security:** Nonces prevent replay attacks by ensuring each authentication attempt is unique
- **Blockchain Integration:** Signature verification provides cryptographic proof of wallet ownership
- **Scalability:** Modular design allows easy upgrade to Redis for production use

---

## Commands Used
- No additional dependencies required (used existing @solana/web3.js and crypto modules)

---

## Errors & Edge Cases
- **Invalid Public Keys:** Gracefully handled in signature verification
- **Invalid Signatures:** Returns false instead of throwing errors
- **Missing Nonces:** Returns null for non-existent nonces
- **Memory Storage:** In-memory storage suitable for development but needs Redis for production

---

## Files Created/Modified
- [`backend/services/nonce.js`](../backend/services/nonce.js): Nonce management service with generate, store, retrieve, and invalidate functions
- [`backend/auth/signature.js`](../backend/auth/signature.js): Solana wallet signature verification using @solana/web3.js

---

## Key Features Implemented

### Nonce Management:
- ✅ **Secure Generation**: Uses crypto.randomBytes for cryptographically secure nonces
- ✅ **Storage**: In-memory Map with timestamps for tracking
- ✅ **Retrieval**: Get nonce by wallet address
- ✅ **Invalidation**: Remove nonce after use to prevent replay attacks
- ✅ **Extensible**: Ready for Redis integration

### Signature Verification:
- ✅ **Solana Integration**: Uses @solana/web3.js for native Solana verification
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid public keys and signatures
- ✅ **Base58 Support**: Proper decoding of Solana's base58 format
- ✅ **Boolean Response**: Clear true/false verification results

## Success Criteria
- [x] Nonce generation and management working
- [x] Signature verification for Solana wallets implemented
- [x] Error handling and edge cases covered
- [x] Ready for integration with authentication service

## Next Steps
- Implement Wallet Authentication Service (Task 3.5.1.2)
- Integrate nonce management with Redis for production
- Add comprehensive testing for nonce and signature logic
