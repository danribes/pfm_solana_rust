# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Dockerized Community Management Application

---

### 1. Introduction/Overview
A containerized community management system that enables members to create and participate in multiple-choice voting, built on the Solana blockchain. The system provides decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof voting for community decision-making, eliminating traditional concerns about vote manipulation, ballot stuffing, and lack of transparency. The application is designed for modular deployment using Docker, supporting a full development and production pipeline.

---

### 2. Goals
- Provide decentralized governance for communities through blockchain-based voting.
- Ensure vote integrity and transparency via immutable blockchain records.
- Enable democratic participation for community members to create and participate in decisions.
- Eliminate intermediaries and central points of failure in community voting processes.
- Support scalable, maintainable, and portable deployment using containerization.

---

### 3. User Stories
**As a Community Administrator:**
- I want to create a community with specific membership criteria so that only relevant stakeholders can participate in decisions.
- I want to approve new members manually so that I can maintain community quality and prevent spam.
- I want to view detailed analytics on voting participation so that I can understand community engagement.

**As a Community Member:**
- I want to join multiple communities that align with my interests so that I can participate in various decision-making processes.
- I want to create a voting question about community issues so that we can make collective decisions.
- I want to vote on questions that matter to me so that I can influence community direction.
- I want to see voting results in real-time so that I can understand community sentiment.

**As a Community Observer:**
- I want to view community voting results so that I can understand the community's decision-making patterns.

### 4. Functional Requirements
1. The system must allow administrators to create and configure communities with custom rules.
2. The system must allow administrators to approve or reject membership applications.
3. The system must allow administrators to monitor community health and participation metrics.
4. The system must provide comprehensive voting analytics for administrators.
5. The system must allow members to request to join communities.
6. The system must allow members to create voting questions with 2-4 multiple-choice options.
7. The system must allow members to cast one vote per question on active voting questions.
8. The system must display real-time and historical voting results to members and observers.
9. The system must track and display personal voting history for each member.
10. The system must enforce voting deadlines automatically.
11. The system must prevent duplicate voting through blockchain validation.
12. The system must maintain immutable voting records on the Solana blockchain.
13. The system must provide a responsive web interface for both administrators and members.
14. The system must support wallet-based authentication for all users.
15. The system must provide public, transparent voting results.

---

### 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- The system will not support ranked-choice or weighted voting.
- The system will not allow anonymous voting (wallet-based identity required).
- The system will not support private/secret voting results.
- The system will not allow vote changes after submission.
- The system will not support complex voting mechanisms (e.g., delegation, quadratic voting).
- The system will not handle fiat currency payments or tokenomics.

---

### 6. Design Considerations
- Modern, clean design inspired by Discord or Slack for a community feel.
- Web3-native experience with prominent wallet connection.
- Mobile-first responsive design for accessibility.
- Support for dark and light themes.
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA standards).
- Key UI components: dashboard, community browser, voting interface, real-time results visualization, member management interface.
- No existing mockups; prioritize usability and clear information hierarchy.

---

### 7. Technical Considerations
- Blockchain: Solana mainnet for production, devnet for testing.
- Smart Contracts: Rust with Anchor framework.
- Frontend: React/Next.js with Solana Web3.js integration.
- Containerization: Docker and Docker Compose for all services.
- Database: PostgreSQL for off-chain data.
- Caching: Redis for session management.
- Cloud-agnostic deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure compatible).
- Horizontal scaling capabilities.
- CDN integration for global performance.
- Wallet-based authentication (no traditional passwords).
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive communications.
- SOC 2 Type II and GDPR compliance considerations.
- Integration with popular wallets (Phantom, Solflare, Ledger).
- Analytics and notification system integration.

---

### 8. Success Metrics
**Technical:**
- All votes are recorded on Solana blockchain with 99.9% reliability.
- Duplicate voting is prevented with 100% accuracy.
- Real-time results update within 30 seconds of vote casting.
- Web interfaces are responsive on desktop and mobile.

**Business:**
- Communities can manage 100+ concurrent members without performance degradation.
- Voting questions can handle 1000+ votes efficiently.
- User registration and approval process takes less than 24 hours.
- System uptime of 99.5% or better.

**User Experience:**
- New users can join a community and cast their first vote within 10 minutes.
- Administrators can create a new voting question in under 3 minutes.
- Voting results are accessible and understandable to non-technical users.

### 9. Open Questions
- What is the process for handling vote ties? Is there a default resolution procedure?
- How should the system handle member removal during active votes?
- What are the procedures for community dissolution and data retention?
- What is the escalation process for smart contract vulnerabilities or wallet compromise?
- Are there any additional compliance requirements for specific jurisdictions?
