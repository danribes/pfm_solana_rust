### Step 6: React Integration Hook
**File created:** `frontend/shared/hooks/useAnalytics.ts` (10.8KB)
**Functions implemented:**
- `useAnalytics()` main hook with complete analytics interface
- State management (isEnabled, isInitialized, sessionId, userId)
- Event tracking functions with error handling
- Configuration management functions
- Data access functions (real-time metrics, report generation)
- Event listener management
- Helper hooks: `usePageTracking()`, `useClickTracking()`, `useErrorTracking()`

### Step 7: Context Provider
**File created:** `frontend/shared/contexts/AnalyticsContext.tsx` (2.8KB)
**Functions implemented:**
- `AnalyticsProvider` component for global state management
- `useAnalyticsContext()` hook for accessing context
- Error boundary handling
- Event counting and state tracking

### Step 8: Integration Testing
**File created:** `backend/tests/integration/analytics_integration.test.js`
**Command used:** `npm test -- tests/integration/analytics_integration.test.js`
**Tests performed:**
1. Analytics Files Verification (3 tests)
2. Analytics API Endpoints (3 tests)
3. Analytics Service Logic (3 tests)
4. Data Analysis and Reporting (2 tests)
5. Performance and Error Handling (2 tests)
