# Task 5.1.2: Cross-Portal Integration & Data Consistency

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of cross-portal integration and data consistency between admin and member portals, ensuring synchronized data and consistent user experience.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Shared State Management:**
   - Global state management across portals
   - State synchronization mechanisms
   - Cross-portal data sharing
   - State persistence and recovery

2. **Portal Communication:**
   - Inter-portal messaging system
   - Event-driven updates
   - Portal switching mechanisms
   - Shared authentication state

3. **Data Consistency:**
   - Data validation across portals
   - Conflict resolution strategies
   - Cache synchronization
   - Real-time data updates

4. **User Experience Integration:**
   - Seamless portal transitions
   - Consistent UI/UX patterns
   - Shared component libraries
   - Unified error handling

---

## Rationale
- **Consistency:** Ensures data integrity across portals
- **User Experience:** Seamless interaction between admin and member views
- **Efficiency:** Shared resources and state reduce redundancy
- **Maintainability:** Centralized integration logic
