# Task 5.2.1: WebSocket Infrastructure for Real-Time Updates

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates across the application, including connection management, event handling, and fallback mechanisms.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **WebSocket Client Setup:**
   - WebSocket connection management
   - Connection state handling
   - Reconnection logic and strategies
   - Connection health monitoring

2. **Event System Implementation:**
   - Event subscription and unsubscription
   - Event routing and handling
   - Event filtering and transformation
   - Event persistence and replay

3. **Real-Time Data Updates:**
   - Live voting result updates
   - Community activity notifications
   - Member status changes
   - System status updates

4. **Fallback and Reliability:**
   - Polling fallback mechanism
   - Connection failure handling
   - Data synchronization on reconnection
   - Offline mode support

---

## Rationale
- **Real-Time Experience:** Live updates enhance user engagement
- **Reliability:** Robust connection handling ensures consistent experience
- **Performance:** Efficient real-time data delivery
- **Scalability:** WebSocket infrastructure supports growth
