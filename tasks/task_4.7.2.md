# Task 4.7.2: Frontend Integration Tests

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of integration tests for frontend features, testing component interactions and user workflows across both admin and member portals.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Component Integration Testing:**
   - Component interaction tests
   - Parent-child component tests
   - Context provider tests
   - Component composition tests

2. **User Workflow Testing:**
   - Complete user journey tests
   - Multi-step process tests
   - Error flow testing
   - Success flow testing

3. **API Integration Testing:**
   - Backend API integration tests
   - Mock API testing
   - Error handling integration
   - Data flow integration

4. **State Management Integration:**
   - Global state integration tests
   - State persistence tests
   - State synchronization tests
   - State reset and cleanup tests

---

## Rationale
- **Reliability:** Ensures features work together correctly
- **User Experience:** Validates complete user workflows
- **Integration:** Tests component and service interactions
- **Quality:** Catches integration-level bugs
