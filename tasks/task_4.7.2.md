## Implementation Progress

### ðŸ”„ **Task 4.7.2: Frontend Integration Tests - STARTING**

Building on the successful completion of Task 4.7.1 (49/49 unit tests passing), now implementing comprehensive integration tests for component interactions and user workflows.

**Current Status:**
- âœ… Unit testing infrastructure established
- âœ… Jest and testing libraries configured
- ðŸš€ Starting integration test implementation

**Sub-task Implementation Plan:**
1. **Component Integration Testing** - Test component interactions and compositions
2. **User Workflow Testing** - Complete user journey testing
3. **API Integration Testing** - Backend integration and data flow
4. **State Management Integration** - Global state and persistence testing

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Component Integration Testing:**
   - Component interaction tests
   - Parent-child component tests
   - Context provider tests
   - Component composition tests

2. **User Workflow Testing:**
   - Complete user journey tests
   - Multi-step process tests
   - Error flow testing
   - Success flow testing

3. **API Integration Testing:**
   - Backend API integration tests
   - Mock API testing
   - Error handling integration
   - Data flow integration

4. **State Management Integration:**
   - Global state integration tests
   - State persistence tests
   - State synchronization tests
   - State reset and cleanup tests

---

## Rationale
- **Reliability:** Ensures features work together correctly
- **User Experience:** Validates complete user workflows
- **Integration:** Tests component and service interactions
- **Quality:** Catches integration-level bugs
