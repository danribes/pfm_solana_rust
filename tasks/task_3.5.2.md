# Task 3.5.2: Session Management & Security

**Status:** Completed

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of comprehensive session management and security features for the wallet-based authentication system. All required features are now implemented, including Redis-based session storage, security middleware, session lifecycle management, CSRF protection, monitoring, auditing, analytics, and health checks.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Session Store Implementation:**
   - Implemented Redis-based session storage in `backend/session/store.js`.
   - Set up session serialization, encryption, expiration, and cleanup.
   - Added session data validation and per-user session tracking.

2. **Security Features:**
   - Implemented session hijacking protection, timeout enforcement, and concurrent session limit in `backend/session/security.js`.
   - Added CSRF protection middleware in `backend/middleware/csrf.js`.
   - Configured secure cookie settings and session auto-logout.

3. **Session Lifecycle Management:**
   - Handled session creation, refresh, and invalidation in `backend/session/auth.js`.
   - Added concurrent session management and session tracking.

4. **Monitoring and Auditing:**
   - Implemented comprehensive audit logging in `backend/services/audit.js`.
   - Added session analytics and monitoring in `backend/session/analytics.js`.
   - Implemented session health checks in `backend/session/health.js`.
   - Set up session activity logging and security event tracking.

## Rationale
- **Security:** Protects against session-based attacks and CSRF.
- **User Experience:** Provides seamless session management.
- **Compliance:** Meets security best practices and standards.
- **Monitoring:** Enables security monitoring and incident response.
