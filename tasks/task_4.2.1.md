## Steps to Take
1. **Wallet Provider Integration:**
   - Integrate Solana wallet adapters (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
   - Implement wallet detection and connection logic
   - Create wallet connection state management
   - Handle wallet disconnection and reconnection

2. **Connection UI Components:**
   - Wallet connection button and modal
   - Connection status indicators
   - Wallet selection interface
   - Connection error handling and messaging

3. **Wallet State Management:**
   - Implement wallet connection context/provider
   - Manage wallet connection state across components
   - Handle wallet account changes and updates
   - Persist connection preferences

4. **Network and Environment Support:**
   - Support for Solana mainnet and devnet
   - Environment-specific wallet configuration
   - Network switching capabilities
   - Connection validation and verification
