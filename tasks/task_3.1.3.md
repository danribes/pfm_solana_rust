# Task 3.1.3: Database Models & ORM Integration

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of database models using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system to provide a clean interface for database operations in the backend services.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Choose and Configure ORM:**
   - Select appropriate ORM (e.g., Prisma, Sequelize, TypeORM)
   - Configure ORM with database connection
   - Set up model definitions and relationships

2. **Implement Core Models:**
   - `User` model with wallet associations
   - `Community` model with metadata
   - `Member` model with membership status
   - `VotingQuestion` model with analytics
   - `Vote` model with vote records
   - `Session` model with session management
   - `Analytics` model with metrics

3. **Define Model Relationships:**
   - One-to-many relationships (User -> Communities, Community -> Questions)
   - Many-to-many relationships (Users <-> Communities through Members)
   - Cascade operations for data integrity

4. **Implement Model Methods:**
   - CRUD operations for each model
   - Custom query methods for complex operations
   - Validation and business logic methods

---

## Rationale
- **Code Quality:** ORM provides type safety and clean abstractions
- **Productivity:** Reduces boilerplate code for database operations
- **Maintainability:** Centralized model definitions and relationships
- **Performance:** ORM optimizations and query caching

## Files to Create/Modify
- `backend/models/User.js` - User model
- `backend/models/Community.js` - Community model
- `backend/models/Member.js` - Member model
- `backend/models/VotingQuestion.js` - Voting question model
- `backend/models/Vote.js` - Vote model
- `backend/models/Session.js` - Session model
- `backend/models/Analytics.js` - Analytics model
- `backend/models/index.js` - Model exports and relationships

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] ORM configured and connected to database
- [ ] All core models implemented with proper relationships
- [ ] CRUD operations working for all models
- [ ] Model validation and business logic implemented
- [ ] Complex queries and relationships tested
