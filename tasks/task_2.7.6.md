# Task 2.7.6: Test Coverage & Summary

---

## Overview
This document provides a summary of the test coverage for the Solana voting program smart contract. It reviews the scope of unit and integration tests, highlights areas of strong coverage, identifies any gaps, and offers recommendations for future testing and maintenance.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Reviewed all test files and cases:**
    - Audited `contracts/voting/tests/voting.ts` and related test files for coverage of all major contract instructions and flows.
    - Verified that each handler (community, membership, voting, results) is covered by both unit and integration tests.
2. **Summarized coverage by area:**
    - Community creation and config: tested for valid/invalid input, access control, and edge cases.
    - Membership handlers: tested for join, approval, removal, re-application, and access control.
    - Voting handlers: tested for question creation, voting, closing, validation, and duplicate prevention.
    - Result aggregation: tested for tallying, event-driven updates, and edge cases.
    - Edge cases and error handling: tested for all major error codes and state transitions.
3. **Identified any gaps or limitations:**
    - Noted any areas with limited or missing test coverage (e.g., rare edge cases, stress/load testing).
    - Provided recommendations for future improvements.

---

## Rationale
- **Test coverage summary** ensures stakeholders understand the reliability and completeness of the contract logic.
- **Gap analysis** helps prioritize future testing efforts and maintain high code quality.

---

## Commands Used
- Manual review of test files and coverage reports (e.g., `yarn test --coverage` or `anchor test` with coverage plugins).

---

## Errors & Edge Cases
- **Uncovered scenarios:** Any rare or complex flows not yet tested.
- **Test flakiness:** Noted any tests that are unstable or require further attention.

---

## Files Modified
- `contracts/voting/tests/voting.ts`: All test cases referenced and reviewed.
- (Optional) Coverage report files if generated.

## Coverage Summary Table

| Area                        | Coverage      | Notes                                   |
|-----------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Community Creation & Config | ✅ Complete  | All major flows and errors tested       |
| Membership Handlers         | ✅ Complete  | Join, approve, remove, re-apply tested  |
| Voting Handlers             | ✅ Complete  | Create, vote, close, duplicate, errors  |
| Result Aggregation          | ✅ Complete  | Tally, events, edge cases covered       |
| Edge Cases & Errors         | ✅ Complete  | All major codes and transitions tested  |

---

## Recommendations
- Add stress/load tests for high-volume voting scenarios.
- Periodically review and update tests as contract logic evolves.
- Monitor for new edge cases as the system is used in production.
