# Task 2.6.2: Real-Time Result Event Emission

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of real-time result event emission in the Solana voting program. It covers how events are emitted for vote casting and question closure to support real-time off-chain aggregation and frontend updates.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Event emission for vote casting:**
    - The `cast_vote` handler emits a `VoteCast` event after a successful vote.
    - The event includes the question public key, voter public key, selected option, and timestamp.
    - Off-chain indexers and frontends can subscribe to these events for real-time updates.

2. **Event emission for question closure:**
    - The `close_voting_question` handler emits a `VotingQuestionClosed` event after a question is closed.
    - The event includes the question public key, the closer's public key, and timestamp.
    - Enables off-chain systems to detect when voting is finalized and results can be aggregated.

3. **Event structure:**
    - `VoteCast` event: `{ question, voter, selected_option, timestamp }`
    - `VotingQuestionClosed` event: `{ question, closer, timestamp }`
    - Events are defined using the Anchor `#[event]` macro for efficient serialization and indexing.

---

## Rationale
- **Real-time updates:** Events allow frontends and indexers to update results instantly as votes are cast or questions are closed.
- **Off-chain aggregation:** Events provide a scalable way to aggregate results without requiring on-chain computation.
- **Auditability:** Events create a verifiable log of all voting activity for transparency and analytics.
