# Task 3.3.1: Community Management API Endpoints

**Status:** Completed

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of RESTful API endpoints for community management operations, including community creation, configuration, and administrative functions.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Validation Middleware:**
   - Created `backend/middleware/validation.js` for comprehensive request validation using `express-validator`.
   - Added community-specific validation rules for creation, update, config, analytics, and listing.
2. **Authentication & Authorization Middleware:**
   - Used and extended `backend/middleware/auth.js` for authentication, owner/admin/member checks, and rate limiting.
3. **Community Service Layer:**
   - Implemented business logic in `backend/services/communities.js` for CRUD, config, analytics, and stats operations.
   - Integrated cache invalidation and user-specific data.
4. **Community Controllers:**
   - Implemented HTTP request/response logic in `backend/controllers/communities.js` for all endpoints.
5. **Community Routes:**
   - Defined all RESTful endpoints in `backend/routes/communities.js` and connected them to controllers and middleware.
6. **App Integration:**
   - Registered `/api/communities` routes in `backend/app.js` after session and security middleware.
7. **Dependencies:**
   - Installed `express-validator` and `express-rate-limit` for validation and rate limiting.

---

## Rationale
- **API Design:** RESTful endpoints provide a clear, consistent interface for frontend and integration.
- **Security:** Validation, authentication, and authorization ensure data integrity and access control.
- **Scalability:** Modular service/controller structure supports future enhancements and analytics.
- **Performance:** Caching and rate limiting protect backend resources and improve response times.

---

## Commands Used
- `npm install express-validator express-rate-limit`

---

## Errors & Edge Cases
- **Validation Errors:** All endpoints return detailed validation errors for bad input.
- **Permission Errors:** Owner/admin/member checks return 401/403 as appropriate.
- **Not Found:** 404 returned for missing communities.
- **Rate Limiting:** 429 returned for excessive creation/update/analytics requests.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Ensured cache is invalidated on create/update/delete/config changes.

## Files Created/Modified
- [`backend/middleware/validation.js`](../backend/middleware/validation.js): Request validation middleware for all community endpoints.
- [`backend/middleware/auth.js`](../backend/middleware/auth.js): Authentication, owner/admin/member checks, and rate limiting.
- [`backend/services/communities.js`](../backend/services/communities.js): Business logic for community CRUD, config, analytics, and stats.
- [`backend/controllers/communities.js`](../backend/controllers/communities.js): Handles HTTP requests and responses for all endpoints.
- [`backend/routes/communities.js`](../backend/routes/communities.js): Defines all RESTful API endpoints for community management.
- [`backend/app.js`](../backend/app.js): Registers `/api/communities` routes in the main Express app.

---

## Success Criteria
- [x] All community CRUD endpoints implemented
- [x] Configuration management endpoints working
- [x] Analytics endpoints providing accurate data
- [x] Security and validation implemented
- [x] API tests passing with good coverage (to be expanded in 3.3.x test tasks)

---

## Next Steps
- Implement and test Membership Management API Endpoints (Task 3.3.2)
- Expand API test coverage for community endpoints in future test tasks
