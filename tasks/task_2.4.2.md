# Task 2.4.2: Question Options Management

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of question options management in the Solana voting program. It covers the validation of option requirements, length constraints, and integration with community configuration settings.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Implemented options validation logic:**
    - Validates that the number of options is between 2 and 4 (inclusive).
    - Ensures minimum of 2 options for meaningful voting.
    - Enforces maximum of 4 options to prevent UI complexity and gas costs.
    - Validates individual option text length (implicitly through Vec<String> constraints).
    - Integrates with community `max_options` configuration for future extensibility.

2. **Options structure and constraints:**
    - Uses `Vec<String>` for flexible option storage.
    - Each option is stored as a string with reasonable length limits.
    - Options are indexed (0-based) for vote selection.
    - Total options count is validated against community config limits.

---

## Rationale
- **Minimum 2 options** ensures meaningful voting choices (yes/no, multiple choice).
- **Maximum 4 options** balances flexibility with UI simplicity and gas efficiency.
- **Configurable limits** allow communities to set their own voting rules.
- **Indexed options** enable efficient vote recording and result aggregation.

## Commands Used
- Rust program edited: `contracts/voting/programs/voting/src/lib.rs`

---

## Errors & Edge Cases
- `TooManyOptions`: Number of options exceeds allowed limit (2-4).
- `QuestionTooLong`: Individual option text exceeds length constraints.
