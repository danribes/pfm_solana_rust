   - Multi-domain certificate support for all application domains
   - ECDSA P-384 and RSA 4096-bit certificate support
   - Secure certificate storage with proper permissions

2. **✅ Automated renewal works reliably with monitoring**
   - Twice-daily renewal scheduling implemented
   - Comprehensive monitoring system with multi-level alerts
   - Emergency backup and recovery procedures
   - Zero-downtime certificate replacement

3. **✅ TLS configuration achieves A+ security rating**
   - Modern TLS protocols only (TLS 1.2 and 1.3)
   - Secure cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy
   - OCSP stapling enabled for certificate validation
   - Mozilla Modern compatibility level achieved

4. **✅ Security headers provide comprehensive protection**
   - Complete security header suite implemented
   - Content Security Policy with strict rules
   - HSTS with preload list eligibility
   - Clickjacking and MIME-sniffing protection

5. **✅ Certificate monitoring prevents expiration incidents**
   - Multi-level alert system (warning, critical, emergency)
   - Automated monitoring with real-time validation
   - Emergency response procedures
   - Certificate transparency monitoring
