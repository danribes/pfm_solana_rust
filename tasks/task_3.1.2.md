# Task 3.1.2: Database Connection & Configuration

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of database connection management, configuration, and connection pooling for the PostgreSQL database in the backend services.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Set up Database Connection:**
   - Configure connection parameters (host, port, database, credentials)
   - Implement connection pooling for performance
   - Set up connection retry logic and error handling

2. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Create environment variables for database settings
   - Implement configuration validation
   - Set up different configurations for development, staging, and production

3. **Connection Management:**
   - Implement connection lifecycle management
   - Set up connection monitoring and health checks
   - Configure connection timeouts and limits

4. **Security Configuration:**
   - Implement SSL/TLS connections
   - Set up proper authentication
   - Configure connection encryption

---

## Rationale
- **Performance:** Connection pooling reduces connection overhead
- **Reliability:** Proper error handling and retry logic ensures stability
- **Security:** SSL/TLS and proper authentication protect data
- **Scalability:** Connection management supports high concurrent usage

## Files to Create/Modify
- `backend/config/database.js` - Database configuration
- `backend/database/connection.js` - Connection management
- `backend/database/pool.js` - Connection pooling
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Database connections established successfully
- [ ] Connection pooling configured and tested
- [ ] Environment configuration validated
- [ ] Security settings implemented
- [ ] Connection monitoring and health checks working
