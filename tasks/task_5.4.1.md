# Task 5.4.1: Blockchain Error Handling & Recovery

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms for blockchain operations, ensuring robust handling of network failures and transaction issues.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Network Failure Handling:**
   - Connection loss detection
   - Network status monitoring
   - Automatic reconnection strategies
   - Network quality assessment

2. **Transaction Error Management:**
   - Transaction failure detection
   - Error categorization and logging
   - Retry mechanisms with backoff
   - Transaction rollback strategies

3. **User Feedback and Recovery:**
   - Clear error messages to users
   - Recovery action suggestions
   - Progress indicators during recovery
   - Manual intervention options

4. **System Resilience:**
   - Graceful degradation
   - Offline mode support
   - Data persistence during failures
   - Recovery state management

---

## Rationale
- **Reliability:** Robust error handling ensures system stability
- **User Experience:** Clear feedback helps users understand and resolve issues
- **Recovery:** Automatic recovery mechanisms reduce manual intervention
- **Monitoring:** Comprehensive error tracking enables system improvement
