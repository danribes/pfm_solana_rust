# Task 6.4.1: Monitoring & Alerting for All Services

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of monitoring and alerting for contracts, backend, and frontend services.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Monitoring Setup:**
   - Integrate monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
   - Collect metrics from all services
   - Set up dashboards for key metrics
   - Monitor resource usage and performance

2. **Alerting Configuration:**
   - Define alert rules for errors, downtime, and anomalies
   - Integrate with notification channels (Slack, email, etc.)
   - Set up escalation policies
   - Test alert delivery and response

3. **Log Aggregation:**
   - Centralize logs from all services (ELK, Loki, etc.)
   - Configure log retention and search
   - Set up log-based alerts
   - Document log formats and access

4. **Health Checks:**
   - Implement health endpoints for all services
   - Automate health check monitoring
   - Integrate with CI/CD for pre/post-deploy checks
   - Document health check procedures

## Rationale
- **Reliability:** Early detection of issues
- **Visibility:** Centralized monitoring and logs
- **Responsiveness:** Fast incident response
- **Quality:** Continuous improvement via metrics
