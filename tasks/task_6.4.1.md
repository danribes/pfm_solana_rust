## Error Handling and Solutions

### Error 1: Docker Compose Network Issues
**Problem:** External network reference causing deployment failures
**Solution:** Created conditional network configuration with fallback to bridge mode
**Fix Applied:** Updated docker-compose.monitoring.yml with proper network references

### Error 2: Prometheus Service Discovery
**Problem:** Dynamic service names not resolving in containerized environment
**Solution:** Implemented environment variable substitution in prometheus.yml
**Fix Applied:** Used `${ENVIRONMENT:-staging}` pattern for dynamic service names

### Error 3: Grafana Dashboard Import
**Problem:** Dashboard JSON format compatibility issues
**Solution:** Structured dashboard configuration with proper provisioning
**Fix Applied:** Created separate dashboard provider configuration

### Error 4: AlertManager SMTP Configuration
**Problem:** Email notifications not working in containerized environment
**Solution:** Implemented environment variable-based SMTP configuration
**Fix Applied:** Added comprehensive email template configuration
