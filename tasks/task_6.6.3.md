# Task 6.6.3: SSL/TLS Certificate Management & Security

---

## Overview
Implement comprehensive SSL/TLS certificate management and security infrastructure for the PFM Community Management Application. This ensures secure encrypted connections, proper certificate lifecycle management, and compliance with security best practices.

---

## Steps to Take

### 1. **Certificate Acquisition & Installation**
   - Let's Encrypt or commercial certificate procurement
   - Multi-domain and wildcard certificate setup
   - Certificate chain validation and installation
   - Backup certificate generation and storage
   - Certificate transparency monitoring

### 2. **Automated Certificate Renewal**
   - ACME client configuration (Certbot, acme.sh)
   - Automated renewal scheduling and validation
   - Zero-downtime certificate replacement
   - Renewal failure detection and alerting
   - Backup renewal mechanisms

### 3. **TLS Security Configuration**
   - Modern TLS protocol configuration (TLS 1.2+)
   - Secure cipher suite selection
   - Perfect Forward Secrecy implementation
   - HSTS header configuration
   - OCSP stapling and must-staple

### 4. **Certificate Monitoring & Validation**
   - Certificate expiration monitoring
   - Certificate chain validation
   - Security rating monitoring (SSL Labs)
   - Certificate transparency log monitoring
   - Vulnerability scanning and assessment

### 5. **Security Headers & Policies**
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
   - HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) configuration
   - Referrer Policy and Feature Policy
   - X-Content-Type-Options and X-Frame-Options
   - Security reporting and violation monitoring

---

## Rationale
- **Data Protection:** Ensures all user data is encrypted in transit
- **Trust & Compliance:** Establishes user trust and meets regulatory requirements
- **Security Posture:** Implements industry-standard security practices
- **Automation:** Reduces manual certificate management overhead
