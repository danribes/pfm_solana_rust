# Task 3.2.2: Session Management Implementation

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of session management using Redis for storing user sessions, authentication tokens, and session state in the backend services.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Session Store Implementation:**
   - Implement Redis-based session store
   - Configure session serialization and deserialization
   - Set up session expiration and cleanup
   - Implement session security features (HTTPS, secure cookies)

2. **Authentication Integration:**
   - Integrate session management with wallet-based authentication
   - Implement session token generation and validation
   - Set up session refresh mechanisms
   - Implement session invalidation and logout

3. **Session Data Management:**
   - Store user preferences and settings
   - Cache user permissions and roles
   - Store temporary data and form state
   - Implement session data encryption

4. **Security Features:**
   - Implement session hijacking protection
   - Set up session timeout and automatic logout
   - Implement concurrent session limits
   - Add session audit logging

5. **Express App Integration:**
   - Scaffold Express.js application with session middleware
   - Implement authentication endpoints
   - Add protected API routes
   - Create health monitoring endpoints
   - Set up graceful shutdown handling

---

## Rationale
- **Security:** Centralized session management with proper security controls
- **Performance:** Fast session access and updates
- **Scalability:** Redis supports high concurrent session access
- **Reliability:** Session persistence and failover capabilities
- **Integration:** Complete Express app with all session features integrated

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed Steps:

#### 1. Session Store Implementation ✅
- **Files Created:**
  - `backend/session/store.js` - Redis-based session store with encryption
  - `backend/session/auth.js` - Authentication functions (login, logout, refresh)
  - `backend/session/security.js` - Security middleware (hijacking protection, timeout, limits)
  - `backend/middleware/session.js` - Express session middleware

#### 2. Authentication Integration ✅
- **Features Implemented:**
  - Wallet-based authentication with session tokens
  - Session token generation and validation
  - Session refresh mechanisms
  - Session invalidation and logout
  - User session tracking and management

#### 3. Security Features ✅
- **Security Middleware:**
  - Session hijacking protection with device fingerprinting
  - Session timeout enforcement with automatic logout
  - Concurrent session limits (configurable per user)
  - Comprehensive audit logging for all session events

#### 4. Express App Integration ✅
- **Files Created:**
  - `backend/app.js` - Complete Express application with session integration
  - `backend/test-app.js` - Integration test script for all endpoints
  - `backend/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

- **API Endpoints Implemented:**
  - `GET /health` - System health check with Redis and session status
  - `POST /auth/login` - Wallet-based authentication
  - `POST /auth/logout` - Session termination
  - `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh
  - `GET /api/profile` - User profile (protected)
  - `GET /api/sessions` - User sessions (protected)
  - `DELETE /api/sessions/:id` - Session management (protected)
  - `GET /api/admin/sessions` - Session statistics (protected)

#### 5. Dependencies Installed ✅
```bash
npm install express cors helmet morgan axios
```

### Key Features Implemented:

#### Session Management
- **Redis Integration:** Full Redis client with connection management, retry logic, and health monitoring
- **Session Storage:** Encrypted session data with TTL, device fingerprinting, and metadata tracking
- **Session Lifecycle:** Create, read, update, delete, and refresh operations
- **User Session Tracking:** Multiple sessions per user with automatic cleanup

#### Security Features
- **Hijacking Protection:** Device fingerprint validation and IP tracking
- **Timeout Enforcement:** Automatic session expiration and forced re-authentication
- **Concurrent Limits:** Configurable session limits with oldest session removal
- **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive logging of all session events

#### Express Integration
- **Middleware Stack:** Security, CORS, logging, and session middleware
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- **Health Monitoring:** Redis and session health checks
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Proper cleanup on application termination

### Testing Results:
- All session management functions tested and working
- Security middleware validated with various scenarios
- Express app endpoints tested with integration script
- Redis connection and health monitoring verified

### Environment Configuration:
```bash
# Required environment variables
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-session-key
SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-character-encryption-key
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS=5
SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=30
AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=true
```

### Usage Instructions:
1. **Start Redis server:** `redis-server`
2. **Start Express app:** `node app.js`
3. **Test endpoints:** `node test-app.js`

### Files Modified/Created:
- ✅ `backend/session/store.js` - Session storage implementation
