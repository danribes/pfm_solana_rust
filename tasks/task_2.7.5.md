# Task 2.7.5: Edge Case & Error Handling Tests

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation and documentation of tests for edge cases and error handling in the Solana voting program. It covers tests that intentionally trigger validation errors, access control failures, and unusual scenarios across all major contract instructions.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Wrote tests for invalid input and validation errors:**
    - Tested creation and update instructions with missing or malformed input.
    - Tested voting with invalid option indices, deadlines, and question states.
2. **Wrote tests for access control violations:**
    - Attempted restricted actions (e.g., config update, member approval, vote casting) by unauthorized users.
    - Verified correct error codes are returned.
3. **Wrote tests for duplicate and boundary conditions:**
    - Attempted duplicate community/member/vote creation.
    - Tested maximum/minimum allowed values for fields (e.g., name length, options count).
4. **Wrote tests for state transitions and edge flows:**
    - Attempted actions on dissolved communities, closed questions, or removed members.
    - Tested re-application after rejection/removal.

---

## Rationale
- **Edge case and error handling tests** ensure the contract is robust against invalid input and malicious or accidental misuse.
- **Explicit error code checks** improve developer experience and integration reliability.
- **Boundary and state transition coverage** prevents subtle bugs and regressions.

---

## Commands Used
- Rust/Anchor test runner (e.g., `anchor test` or `cargo test` in `contracts/voting`)
- TypeScript test runner for Anchor tests (if applicable)

---

## Errors & Edge Cases
- **Validation errors:** Name/description too long, invalid voting period/options, invalid option index, etc.
- **Access control:** Not admin, not approved member, not pending, etc.
- **Duplicate creation:** Community/member/vote already exists.
- **State transitions:** Actions on dissolved/closed/removed entities.
- **Missing input:** Should fail gracefully.

---

## Files Modified
- `contracts/voting/tests/voting.ts`: Added/updated tests for edge cases and error handling across all contract logic.

### Example: Edge Case & Error Handling Test (TypeScript)
```ts
it('fails to create a community with too long a name', async () => {
  await expect(
    program.rpc.createCommunity(
      'X'.repeat(100),
      'desc',
      { votingPeriod: 86400, maxOptions: 3 },
      { accounts: { /* ... */ } }
    )
  ).to.be.rejectedWith(/NameTooLong/);
});

it('prevents duplicate vote by same member', async () => {
  await program.rpc.castVote(0, { accounts: { /* ... */ } });
  await expect(
    program.rpc.castVote(0, { accounts: { /* ... */ } })
  ).to.be.rejectedWith(/DuplicateVote/);
});

it('fails to approve member as non-admin', async () => {
  await expect(
    program.rpc.approveMember(true, { accounts: { /* ... */ } })
  ).to.be.rejectedWith(/NotAdmin/);
});
```
