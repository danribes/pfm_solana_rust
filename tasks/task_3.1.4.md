# Task 3.1.4: Database Seeding & Testing Data

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of database seeding scripts and test data generation to support development, testing, and demonstration of the community management application.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Create Seeding Scripts:**
   - Generate sample users with wallet addresses
   - Create test communities with various configurations
   - Add sample members with different statuses
   - Create voting questions with options and deadlines
   - Generate sample votes for analytics testing

2. **Environment-Specific Data:**
   - Development environment with minimal test data
   - Testing environment with comprehensive test scenarios
   - Demo environment with realistic sample data
   - Production-safe seeding (no sensitive data)

3. **Data Validation:**
   - Ensure seeded data follows business rules
   - Validate relationships between entities
   - Test data integrity constraints
   - Verify foreign key relationships

4. **Automation:**
   - Integrate seeding with database setup
   - Create scripts for different environments
   - Implement rollback and cleanup procedures

---

## Rationale
- **Development:** Provides realistic data for development and testing
- **Testing:** Ensures consistent test data across environments
- **Demo:** Enables demonstration of application features
- **Quality Assurance:** Validates data integrity and business rules

## Files to Create/Modify
- `backend/database/seeders/` - Seeding scripts directory
- `backend/database/seeders/users.js` - User seeding
- `backend/database/seeders/communities.js` - Community seeding
- `backend/database/seeders/members.js` - Member seeding
- `backend/database/seeders/voting.js` - Voting data seeding
- `backend/database/seeders/index.js` - Main seeding orchestrator
- `backend/scripts/seed.js` - Seeding command line interface

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Seeding scripts create realistic test data
- [ ] Data follows all business rules and constraints
- [ ] Seeding works across different environments
- [ ] Rollback and cleanup procedures implemented
- [ ] Seeding integrated with development workflow
