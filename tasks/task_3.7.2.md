### Steps Taken
1. **Real-time Data Processing:**
   - ✅ Implemented streaming data processing for live analytics (`backend/analytics/streaming.js`)
   - ✅ Set up event-driven data aggregation with EventEmitter
   - ✅ Added real-time metrics calculation with Redis caching
   - ✅ Implemented data validation and quality checks

2. **Batch Processing:**
   - ✅ Set up scheduled data aggregation jobs using node-cron (`backend/analytics/batch.js`)
   - ✅ Implemented historical data processing for daily, weekly, and monthly analytics
   - ✅ Added data transformation and enrichment
   - ✅ Set up data archiving and cleanup processes

3. **Data Warehousing:**
   - ✅ Designed analytics data schema with fact and dimension tables (`backend/analytics/warehouse.js`)
   - ✅ Implemented data warehouse tables (UserAnalytics, CommunityAnalytics, VotingAnalytics, DateDimension)
   - ✅ Set up ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes
   - ✅ Added data partitioning and indexing for performance

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - ✅ Implemented data caching strategies with Redis
   - ✅ Added query optimization for analytics
   - ✅ Set up data compression and storage optimization
   - ✅ Implemented parallel processing for large datasets

5. **Analytics Workers:**
   - ✅ Created background processing workers (`backend/workers/analytics.js`)
   - ✅ Implemented worker thread management for parallel processing
   - ✅ Added error handling and worker restart mechanisms

6. **Aggregation Service:**
   - ✅ Created comprehensive aggregation service (`backend/services/aggregation.js`)
   - ✅ Coordinated between streaming, batch, and warehouse processing
   - ✅ Implemented real-time metrics and statistics collection

7. **Testing:**
   - ✅ Created comprehensive test suites for all components
   - ✅ Added unit tests for streaming analytics (`backend/tests/analytics/streaming.test.js`)
   - ✅ Added unit tests for batch processing (`backend/tests/analytics/batch.test.js`)
   - ✅ Added unit tests for data warehouse (`backend/tests/analytics/warehouse.test.js`)
   - ✅ Added unit tests for aggregation service (`backend/tests/analytics/aggregation.test.js`)
