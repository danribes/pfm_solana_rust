# Task 6.6.1: Public Website Hosting & Domain Setup

---

## Overview
Implement public website hosting infrastructure and domain setup for the PFM Community Management Application. This includes selecting hosting providers, configuring DNS, setting up domain management, and ensuring reliable public access.

---

## Steps to Take

### 1. **Domain Registration & Management**
   - Domain name selection and registration
   - DNS configuration and management
   - Subdomain setup for different environments (app.domain.com, admin.domain.com)
   - Domain security configuration (DNSSEC, domain lock)
   - Email forwarding and professional email setup

### 2. **Hosting Infrastructure Selection**
   - Cloud hosting provider evaluation (AWS, GCP, Azure, Cloudflare Pages, Vercel)
   - Performance and scalability requirements assessment
   - Geographic distribution and CDN integration
   - Cost optimization and pricing analysis
   - Backup and disaster recovery planning

### 3. **Production Environment Configuration**
   - Container orchestration for production deployment
   - Load balancing and auto-scaling setup
   - Database hosting and management
   - File storage and asset management
   - Environment variable and secrets management

### 4. **Monitoring & Uptime Management**
   - Uptime monitoring and alerting
   - Performance monitoring and optimization
   - Error tracking and logging
   - Backup verification and recovery testing
   - Incident response and escalation procedures

### 5. **Security & Compliance**
   - Security headers and configuration
   - DDoS protection and rate limiting
   - Data protection and privacy compliance
   - Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
   - Incident response and security monitoring

## Rationale
- **Public Access:** Enables users to access the platform via a professional domain
- **Reliability:** Ensures high availability and performance for all users
- **Scalability:** Supports platform growth and increasing user demand
- **Security:** Provides enterprise-grade security for public-facing services
