# Task 2.2.4: Tests for Community Creation & Config

---

## Overview
This document describes the test coverage for the community creation and configuration update logic in the Solana voting program.

---

## Test Coverage (Stubbed or Implemented)
- **Community Creation:**
    - Success with valid input.
    - Failure on name/description length.
    - Failure on invalid config (voting period, max options).
    - Event emission (`CommunityCreated`).
- **Config Update:**
    - Success with valid new config.
    - Failure on invalid config values.
    - Access control: only admin can update.
    - (Optional) Event/log emission for config update.

---

## Rationale
- **Comprehensive tests** ensure correctness and prevent regressions.
- **Edge case coverage** for validation and access control.
