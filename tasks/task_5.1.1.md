# Task 5.1.1: Frontend-Backend Integration with Smart Contracts

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of frontend-backend integration with Solana smart contracts, including transaction handling, data synchronization, and error management.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Smart Contract Integration Layer:**
   - Frontend smart contract client setup
   - Transaction building and signing
   - Instruction serialization and deserialization
   - Account data parsing and validation

2. **Backend API Integration:**
   - Frontend API client implementation
   - Request/response handling
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Data transformation and validation

3. **Transaction Management:**
   - Transaction queue management
   - Transaction status tracking
   - Confirmation handling
   - Rollback and error recovery

4. **Data Synchronization:**
   - Real-time data updates
   - Cache invalidation strategies
   - Optimistic updates
   - Conflict resolution

---

## Rationale
- **Reliability:** Robust integration ensures consistent data flow
- **User Experience:** Seamless interaction between frontend and blockchain
- **Performance:** Efficient data synchronization and caching
- **Maintainability:** Clean separation of concerns between layers
