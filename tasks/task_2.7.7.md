# Task 2.7.7: Future Test Enhancements & Maintenance

---

## Overview
This document serves as a placeholder and planning space for future test enhancements and ongoing maintenance of the Solana voting program's test suite. It outlines potential areas for improvement, new testing methodologies, and recommendations for keeping the test suite robust as the codebase evolves.

---

## Steps Taken
- Placeholder: No concrete steps taken yet. This task will be updated as new test requirements or improvements are identified.

---

## Rationale
- **Continuous improvement:** As the contract and ecosystem evolve, new edge cases, features, and vulnerabilities may emerge that require additional testing.
- **Proactive maintenance:** Regularly updating and enhancing the test suite ensures long-term reliability and security.

---

## Recommendations
- Add stress and load tests for high-volume scenarios.
- Integrate fuzz testing to uncover unexpected edge cases.
- Periodically review and update tests as new features are added.
- Monitor for test flakiness and address unstable tests promptly.
- Document any new test strategies or tools adopted.
