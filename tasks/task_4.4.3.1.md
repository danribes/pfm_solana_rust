# Task 4.4.3.1: Create Voting Types and Interfaces

---

## Overview
This subtask focuses on creating comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and types for the voting system. This includes defining data structures for voting questions, options, responses, and state management.

---

## Steps Taken

### 1. Define Core Voting Interfaces
- Create `VotingQuestion` interface for voting question data
- Define `VotingOption` interface for individual vote options
- Implement `Vote` interface for cast votes
- Set up `VotingResult` interface for aggregated results

### 2. Create State Management Types
- Define `VotingState` interface for component state
- Create `VotingAction` types for state updates
- Implement loading and error state types

### 3. Define API Response Types
- Create `VotingAPIResponse` types for API communication
- Define `VotingHistoryResponse` for historical data
- Implement pagination types for large datasets

### 4. Set Up Status and Utility Enums
- Define `VotingStatus` enum (ACTIVE, CLOSED, DRAFT, etc.)
- Create `VoteType` enum for different voting methods
- Implement `VotingError` enum for error handling

---

## Rationale
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive types prevent runtime errors
- **Developer Experience**: Clear interfaces improve code maintainability
- **API Consistency**: Standardized types ensure consistent data flow
- **Scalability**: Flexible interfaces support future voting features

---

## Commands Used
```bash
# Create types directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p frontend/member/src/types

# Create voting types file
touch frontend/member/src/types/voting.ts
```

---

## Files Created/Modified
- `frontend/member/src/types/voting.ts` - Main voting TypeScript interfaces and types

---

## Errors & Edge Cases
- **Blockchain Integration**: Types accommodate future Solana blockchain voting
- **Real-time Updates**: Interfaces support WebSocket data structures
- **Pagination**: Types handle large voting datasets efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types for robust error management
