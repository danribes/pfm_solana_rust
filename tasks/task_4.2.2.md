# Task 4.2.2: Authentication Flows & Session Management

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of wallet-based authentication flows and session management for both admin and member portals.

---

## Steps to Take
1. **Authentication Flow Implementation:**
   - Wallet signature-based authentication
   - Nonce generation and verification
   - Authentication token creation and validation
   - Session establishment and management

2. **Session Management:**
   - Session token storage and retrieval
   - Session expiration and renewal
   - Multi-tab session synchronization
   - Session cleanup and logout handling

3. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - User role determination from blockchain
   - Portal access control based on roles
   - Feature-level permission checking
   - Admin vs member interface routing

4. **Security and Validation:**
   - Message signing and verification
   - Replay attack prevention
   - Session hijacking protection
   - Authentication state validation

---

## Rationale
- **Security:** Secure wallet-based authentication without passwords
- **User Experience:** Seamless authentication flow
- **Scalability:** Role-based access control for different user types
- **Reliability:** Robust session management across browser sessions
