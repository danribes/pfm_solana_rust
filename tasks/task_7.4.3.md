## Errors Encountered and Solutions

### Error 1: Batch Operation Database Deadlocks
**Problem**: Database deadlocks during concurrent batch operations
```bash
Error: deadlock detected - database transaction failed
```

**Solution**: Implemented optimistic locking and batch processing optimization
```javascript
// Optimistic locking for batch operations
const processBatchWithRetry = async (operations, retries = 3) => {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < retries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await processBatch(operations);
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.code === 'DEADLOCK_DETECTED' && attempt < retries - 1) {
        await delay(Math.random() * 1000); // Random delay
        continue;
      }
      throw error;
    }
  }
};
```

### Error 2: Email Service Container Communication
**Problem**: Email notifications failing in containerized environment
```bash
Error: SMTP connection failed - connection refused
```

**Solution**: Configured container networking and email service integration
```yaml
# Email service container configuration
email-service:
  image: pfm-email-service:latest
  environment:
    SMTP_HOST: smtp.gmail.com
    SMTP_PORT: 587
  networks:
    - pfm-network
```

### Error 3: Large Dataset Performance Issues
**Problem**: Admin dashboard slow with large number of applications
```bash
Warning: Query taking >5 seconds to load applications
```

**Solution**: Implemented pagination, indexing, and query optimization
```sql
-- Database indexing for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_join_requests_status_created ON join_requests(status, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_join_requests_community_status ON join_requests(community_id, status);
```

### Error 4: Workflow Rule Evaluation Performance
**Problem**: Complex approval rules causing timeout issues
```bash
Error: Rule evaluation timeout after 30 seconds
```

**Solution**: Optimized rule engine with caching and parallel processing
```javascript
// Optimized rule evaluation with caching
const evaluateRulesWithCache = async (application) => {
  const cacheKey = `rules_${application.communityId}_${application.type}`;
  let rules = await redis.get(cacheKey);
  
  if (!rules) {
    rules = await loadRulesFromDatabase(application.communityId);
    await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(rules));
  } else {
    rules = JSON.parse(rules);
  }
  
  return await Promise.all(rules.map(rule => evaluateRule(rule, application)));
};
```

### Error 5: Document Annotation Memory Issues
**Problem**: Document viewer causing memory leaks with large PDFs
```bash
Error: JavaScript heap out of memory
```

**Solution**: Implemented document virtualization and memory management
```javascript
// Document virtualization for large files
const DocumentViewer = ({ documentUrl }) => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
  const [loadedPages, setLoadedPages] = useState(new Set());
  
  const loadPage = useCallback(async (pageNum) => {
    if (!loadedPages.has(pageNum)) {
      const pageData = await loadDocumentPage(documentUrl, pageNum);
      setLoadedPages(prev => new Set([...prev, pageNum]));
      return pageData;
    }
  }, [documentUrl, loadedPages]);
  
  // Cleanup unused pages from memory
  useEffect(() => {
    const cleanup = () => {
      const pagesToKeep = new Set([
        currentPage - 1, currentPage, currentPage + 1
      ].filter(p => p > 0));
      
      setLoadedPages(prev => 
        new Set([...prev].filter(p => pagesToKeep.has(p)))
      );
    };
    
    cleanup();
  }, [currentPage]);
};
```
