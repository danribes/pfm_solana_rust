# Task 2.2.2: Community Configuration Update Handler

---

## Overview
This document details the implementation of the `update_community_config` instruction, which allows the community admin to update voting configuration parameters after creation.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Implemented `update_community_config` handler:**
    - Accepts a new `CommunityConfig` struct as input.
    - Validates that the new voting period is positive and the number of options is between 2 and 4.
    - Ensures only the community admin can perform this action (access control).
    - Updates the `config` field in the `Community` account.
    - Emits a log message (and could emit an event for off-chain tracking).

---

## Rationale
- **Post-creation flexibility:** Allows communities to adapt their voting rules as needed.
- **Strict validation:** Prevents invalid or dangerous config changes.
- **Access control:** Ensures only the admin can update configuration.
