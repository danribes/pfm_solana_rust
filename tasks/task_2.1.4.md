# Task 2.1.4: Admin & Edge Case Handlers

---

## Overview
This document covers the implementation of administrative handlers (`remove_member`, `dissolve_community`) and the critical edge case logic added to ensure program robustness.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Admin Handler Implementation
-   **`remove_member`:**
    *   Implemented a handler to allow the community `admin` to remove an existing member.
    *   The handler sets the member's `status` to `Removed` (3) and decrements the community's `member_count`.
    *   This action is restricted to the community admin.
-   **`dissolve_community`:**
    *   Implemented a handler for the community `admin` to dissolve the entire community.
    *   This is a terminal action that prevents any further activity.
    *   The community is marked as dissolved by setting its `member_count` to `u32::MAX` as a sentinel value.

### 2. Edge Case Handling
-   **Prevented actions in dissolved communities:**
    *   Added checks to the `join_community`, `create_voting_question`, and `cast_vote` handlers to fail if the target community's `member_count` is `u32::MAX`.
-   **Enforced status checks for actions:**
    *   `create_voting_question` and `cast_vote` handlers now explicitly check that the member's status is `Approved`. Actions by pending, rejected, or removed members will fail.
-   **Allowed re-application for membership:**
    *   The `join_community` handler was updated to allow a user to re-apply if their previous status was `Rejected` (2) or `Removed` (3). The handler re-initializes their `Member` account and sets the status back to `Pending`.

## Rationale
-   **Moderation and Control:** The `remove_member` and `dissolve_community` handlers provide necessary administrative tools for managing the community's lifecycle.
-   **Robustness and Predictability:** The edge case handling is crucial for preventing invalid state transitions and ensuring the program behaves as expected under all conditions. For example, it prevents a removed member from voting or a new member from joining a defunct community.
-   **Fairness and Recovery:** Allowing re-application gives users a chance to rejoin a community after being rejected or removed, which supports more flexible community dynamics.
-   **Gas Efficiency:** Using a sentinel value (`u32::MAX`) is a gas-efficient way to check for the dissolved state without adding a new boolean field to the `Community` account.
